EXECUTIVE PROGRAMME – TAX LAWS AND PRACTICE
This study material has been published to aid the students in preparing for the Tax Laws and Practice paper of the
CS Executive Programme. It is part of the educational kit and takes the students step by step through each phase
of preparation stressing key concepts, pointers and procedures. Company Secretaryship being a professional
course, the examination standards are set very high, with emphasis on knowledge of concepts, applications,
procedures and case laws, for which sole reliance on the contents of this study material may not be enough.
Besides, as per the Company Secretaries Regulations, 1982, students are expected to be conversant with the
amendments to the laws made upto six months preceding the date of examination. The material may, therefore, be
regarded as the basic material and must be read alongwith the original Bare Acts, Rules, Orders, Case Laws,
Student Company Secretary e-bulletin published and supplied to the students by the Institute every month as well
as recommended readings given with each study lesson.
The subject of Tax Laws is inherently complicated and is subjected to constant refinement through new primary
legislations, rules and regulations made thereunder and court decisions on specific legal issues. It therefore becomes
necessary for every student to constantly update himself with the various changes made as well as judicial
pronouncements rendered from time to time by referring to the Institutes journal ‘Chartered Secretary’ and ‘Student
Company Secretary e-bulletin’ as well as other law/professional journals on tax laws.
The purpose of this study material is to impart conceptual understanding to the students of the provisions of the
Direct Tax Laws (Income Tax) and Indirect Tax Laws (Service Tax, Value Added Tax, Central Sales Tax & GST)
covered in the Syllabus. This study material has been updated upto 30th June, 2016 and contains relevant
amendments made by Finance Act, 2016 applicable for the Assessment Year 2017-18. This is relevant for students
appearing in June, 2017 session onwards. However, it may so happen that some developments might have taken
place during the printing of the study material and its supply to the students. The students are therefore, advised to
refer to the Student Company Secretary e-bulletin and other publications for updation of the study material.
In the event of any doubt, students may write to the Institute at academics@icsi.edu for clarification.
Although care has been taken in publishing this study material yet the possibility of errors, omissions and/or
discrepancies cannot be ruled out. This publication is released with an understanding that the Institute should not
be responsible for any errors, omissions and/or discrepancies or any action taken in that behalf.
Should there be any discrepancy, error or omission noted in the study material, the Institute shall be obliged if the
same are brought to its notice for issue of corrigendum in the Student Company Secretary e-bulletin.
The Institute has decided that the examination for this paper will be held in the Optical Mark Recognition (OMR)
format, whereby students are required to answer multiple choice questions on OMR sheet by darkening the appropriate
choice by HB pencil. One mark will be awarded for each correct answer. Negative marking for wrong answers
attempted by the candidates will be implemented w.e.f. December, 2015 session of examination in the ratio of 1: 4,
i.e. deduction of one (1) mark for every four (4) wrong answers and total marks obtained by the candidates would be
rounded up to next whole number. Further, the negative marks would be limited to the extent of marks secured for
correct answers so that no candidate shall secure less than zero mark.
The specimen OMR sheet is appended at the end of the study material. There is practice test paper in the study to
acquaint students with the pattern of examination. These are for practice purpose only, not to be sent to the institute.
Note : This study material is based on Finance Act, 2016 applicable for Assessment Year 2017-18 and is useful for
students appearing in June, 2017 session onwards .

INTRODUCTION
– Tax is the financial charge imposed by the Government on income, commodity or activity. Government
imposes two types of taxes namely Direct taxes and Indirect taxes. Direct tax is one where burden
of tax is directly on the payer e.g income tax, Indirect tax is paid by the person other than the one
who utilizes the product or service e.g Excise duty, Custom duty, Service tax, Sales Tax, Value
Added Tax.
– The taxes are collected for serving the primary purpose of providing sufficient revenues to the State,
these have become an instrument through which the social and economic objectives of a welfare State
could be achieved. They are utilized now for providing incentives for larger earnings and more savings,
fostering industrial development by selective concessions, restraining ostentatious expenditure, checking
inflationary pressures and achieving social objectives.
– Article 265 of the Constitution provides that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law.
Thus, the tax proposed to be levied or collected must be within the legislative competence of the legislature
imposing the tax. Further, the law imposing the tax, like other laws, must not violate any fundamental
right.
– Income tax is an entry appearing in the union list, thus the responsibility for collection of income-tax
vests with the Central Government. Entry 82 of List I to the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India
confers power on Parliament to levy taxes on income other than agricultural income.
– The taxes and duties referred to in the Union list except those referred to in Articles 268 and 269,
surcharge on taxes and duties and any cess levied by the Parliament for specific purposes are to be
collected by the Government of India and are to be distributed between the Union and the States in the
manner prescribed by the President by order.
– Income tax being direct tax happens to be the major source of revenue for the Central Government.
The responsibility for collection of income-tax vests with the Central Government. This tax is leviable
and collected under Income-tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as the Act). The entire amount of
income tax collected by the Central Government is classified under the head:
1. Corporation Tax (Tax on the income of the companies); and
2. Income tax (Tax on income of the non-corporate assessees)
– The Income-tax Act, in its present form came into force on and from 1st April, 1962. Before this, the
Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 was in force. The procedural matters with regard to income-tax are governed
by the Income-tax Rules, 1962, its earlier counterpart being the Income-tax Rules, 1922.
– The Income tax Act contains the provisions for determination of taxable income, determination of tax
liability, procedure for assessment, appeal, penalties and prosecutions. It also lays down the powers
and duties of various income tax authorities.
– Finance Act: Every year a Budget is presented before the parliament by the Finance Minister. One of
the important components of the Budget is the Finance Bill. The Bill contains various amendments in the
Income-Tax Act and prescribes the rates of taxes. When the Finance Bill is approved by both the houses
of parliament and receives the assent of President, it becomes the Finance Act.
– Notifications: The CBDT issues notifications from time to time, these are for the proper administration of
the Income Tax Act.

4 EP-TL&P
– Circulars: Circulars are issued by the CBDT to clarify the doubts regarding the scope and meaning of
the provisions of the law and provide guidance to the Income Tax officers and assesses. These circulars
are binding on the department, not on the assessee but assessee can take benefit of these circulars.
– Judicial Decisions: Decisions pronounced by Supreme Court become Judicial Precedent and are binding
on all the courts, Appellate Tribunal, Income Tax Authorities and on assesses. Further, High Court
decisions are binding on assesses and Income Tax Authorities which come under its jurisdiction unless
it is overruled by a higher authority. The decision of a High Court can not bind other High Court.

BASIC CONCEPTS OF INCOME TAX ACT
“Income Tax is levied on the total income of the previous year of every person.”
To levy income tax, one must have an understanding of the various concepts related to the charge of tax like
previous year, assessment year, Income, total income, person etc.

PERSON [SECTION 2(31)]
Income-tax is charged in respect of the total income of the previous year of every person. Hence, it is important
to know the definition of the word person. As per section 2(31), Person includes:
– an individual:
– a Hindu undivided family:
– a company
– a firm
– an association of persons or a body of individuals whether incorporated or not:
– a local authority:
– every artificial, juridical person, not falling within any of the above categories

An individual
A natural human being, i.e. male, female, minor or a person of sound or unsound mind.

A Hindu undivided family
It consists of all persons lineally descended from a common ancestor and includes their wives and unmarried
daughters.
Note: For details refer the chapter on Assessment of Hindu Undivided Families.

A Company
Section 2(17) defines the term ‘company’ to mean:
(i) any Indian company, or
(ii) any body corporate incorporated by or under the laws of a country outside India i.e. a foreign company,
or
(iii) any institution, association or body which is or was assessable or was assessed as a company for any
assessment year under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 or which is or was assessable or was assessed
under this Act as a company for any assessment year commencing on or before the 1st day of April,
1970, or

Lesson 1

Introduction and Important Definitions

5

(iv) any institution, association or body, whether incorporated or not and whether Indian or non-Indian,
which is declared by general or special order of the Board to be a company only for such assessment
year or assessment years (whether commencing before the first day of April, 1971 or, on or after that
date), as may be specified in the declaration.

A Firm
A firm includes a partnership firm whether registered or not and shall include a Limited Liability Parternship as
defined in the Limited Liability Parternship Act, 2008.

An association of persons or a body of individuals whether incorporated or not
The difference between Association of persons and body of individuals is that whereas an association implies a
voluntary getting together for a definite purpose, a body of individuals would be just a body without an intention
to get-together. Moreover, the members of body of individuals can be individuals only whereas the members of
an association of persons can be individual or non-individuals (i.e. artificial persons).

A local authority
It means a municipal committee, district board, body of port commissioners, or other authority legally entitled to
or entrusted by the Government with the control and management of a Municipal or local fund.

Every artificial, juridical person, not falling within any of the above categories
This is a residuary clause. If the assessee does not fall in any of the first six categories, he is assessed under
this clause. Generally, a statutory corporation, deity or charitable institution or an endowment for charitable or
religious purposes falls under artificial juridical person.

ASSESSEE [Section 2(7)]
In common parlance every tax payer is an assessee. However, the word assessee has been defined in Section
2(7) of the Act according to which assessee means a person by whom any tax or any other sum of money (i.e.
interest, penalty etc.) is payable under the Act and includes:
(a) every person in respect of whom any proceeding under this Act has been taken for the assessment of
his income or assessment of fringe benefits or of the income of any other person in respect of which he
is assessable or to determine the loss sustained by him or by such other person or to determine the
amount of refund due to him or to such other person.
(b) every person who is deemed to be an assessee under any provision of this Act.
(c) every person who is deemed to be an assessee in default under any provision of this Act.
Accordingly, assessee is a person by whom tax or any other sum is payable under the Act.
The expression “other sum of money” includes
– fine, interest, penalty and tax or
– person to whom any refund of tax etc. is due under the Act or
– if any proceeding under the Act has been taken against any person, he is also an assessee. Remember,
the proceedings must be initiated under the provisions of the Act. In other words, a single enquiry letter
issued by the Income-tax Department without reference to any specific provision of the Act does not
constitute proceeding under the Act and, as such, till proceedings are initiated under the Act, the person
may not become an assessee within the ambit of Section 2(7) of the Act.

ASSESSMENT YEAR [SECTION 2(9)]
“Assessment year” means the period of twelve months commencing on 1st April every year. Thus it is normally

6 EP-TL&P
period begining on 1st April of one year and ending on 31st March of the next year. Income of previous year of
an assessee is taxed during the following assessment year at the rates prescribed by the relevant Finance Act.

PREVIOUS YEAR (SECTION 3)
Previous year means the financial year immediately preceding the assessment year. Income earned in a year is
taxable in the next year. The year in which income is earned is known as previous year. From the assessment
year 1989-90 onwards, all assessees are required to follow financial year (i.e. April 1st of one year to March 31st
of next year) as previous year. The uniform previous year has to be followed for all sources of income.
In case of newly set up business or profession or a source of income newly coming into existence, the first
previous year will be the period commencing from the date of setting up of business/profession or as the case
may be, the date on which the source of income newly comes into existence and ending on the immediately
following March, 31.
Examples of previous year in the case of newly set-up business/profession:
Example 1
Y sets up a new business on May 15, 2016. What is the previous year for the assessment year 2017-18.
Ans. Previous year for the assessment year 2017-18 is the period commencing on May 15, 2016 and ending on
March 31, 2017.

Concept of Income
In general terms, Income is a periodical monetary return with some sort of regularity. However, the Income Tax
Act, even certain income which does not arise regularly are treated as income for tax purposes e.g. Winnings
from lotteries, crossword puzzles.
A study of some of the broad principles given below will help to understand the concept of income:
1. Cash or kind
Income may be received in cash or kind. When the income is received in kind, its valuation will be made
in accordance with the rules prescribed in the Income-tax Rules, 1962.
2. Receipt basis/ Accrual basis
Income arises either on receipt basis or on accrual basis. It may accrue to a taxpayer without its actual
receipt. The income in some cases is deemed to accrue or arise to a person without its actual accrual or
receipt. Income accrues where the right to receive arises.
3. Legal or illegal source
The income-tax law does not make any distinction between income accrued or arisen from a legal
source and income tainted with illegality. In CIT v. Piara Singh (1980) 3 Taxman 67, the Supreme Court

Lesson 1

has held that if smuggling activity can be regarded as a business, the confiscation of currency notes by
customs authorities is a loss which springs directly from the carrying on of the business and is, therefore,
permissible as a deduction.
4. Temporary/Permanent
There is no difference between temporary and permanent income under the Act. Even temporary income
is taxable under the Income Tax Act.
5. Lumpsum/instalments
Income whether received in lump sum or in instalments is liable to tax. For example: arrears of salary or
bonus received in lump sum is income and charged to tax as salary.
6. Gifts
Gifts of personal nature do not constitute income subject to maximum of `50,000 received in cash. The
recipient of gifts like birthday, marriage gifts, etc., is not liable to income-tax as received in kind however
as per the Finance Act, 2009 gifts in kind having fair value upto `50,000 are not liable to tax but having
fair value of more than ` 50,000 is wholly taxable.
7. Revenue or Capital receipt: Income-tax, as the name implies, is a tax on income and not a tax on
every item of money received. Therefore, unless the receipt in question constitutes income as
distinguished from capital, it cannot be charged to tax. For this purpose, income should be distinguished
from capital which gives rise to income. However, some capital receipts have been specifically included
in the definition of income. The distinction between revenue or capital receipt is dealt in detail in the
later part of chapter.

INCOME
The definition of Income as given in Section 2(24) of the Act starts with the word includes therefore the list is
inclusive not exhaustive. The definition enumerates certain items, including those which cannot ordinarily be
considered as income but are treated statutorily as such. Income includes not only those things which the
interpretation clause declares rather it also includes all things which the word signifies according to its natural
import.

CAPITAL AND REVENUE RECEIPTS
An amount referable to fixed capital is a capital receipt whereas a receipt referable to circulating capital would be
a revenue receipt. While the latter is chargeable to tax, the former is not subject to income-tax unless otherwise
expressly provided.

Type of Capital
1. Fixed capital
Fixed capital is that which is not involved directly in the process of business but remains unaffected by the process.
2. Circulating Capital
Circulating capital is that part of the capital which is turned over in the business and which ultimately results in
profit or loss. For instance, the proceeds of sale of stock-in-trade is a revenue receipt while the sale proceeds
of building, machinery or plant will be capital receipt.

10 EP-TL&P
Type of capital will depend upon the nature of business
The very same thing may be fixed capital in the hands of one business but circulating capital in the hands of
another. Machinery in the hands of a manufacturer is part of his fixed capital, whereas the same machinery with
a machinery dealer is part of his circulating capital.
Nature of receipt also depends upon the reference to the recipient
Whether a particular receipt is capital or revenue in nature must be determined with reference to the recipient who
is sought to be taxed as the assessee. This is essential because the character of the same amount in the hands of
different persons would be different from one another since a capital asset in the hands of one person may be a
trading asset in the hands of another. For tax purposes the capital or revenue character of the receipt must be
determined on the basis of the nature of the trade in the course of which or in connection with which it arises.
Example
– The reimbursement of capital outlay is a capital receipt even if the total amount received exceeds the
cost of the outlay itself.
– Compensation received for the loss of a capital asset is a receipt of a capital nature whereas the
compensation received for damage to or loss of a trading asset is a revenue receipt.
– A capital asset is converted into income and the price realized on its sale takes form of the periodic
payments of a revenue nature;
– Where a person sells his properties and the sale price is payable to him by the purchaser in the form of
annuities of a fixed sum so long as the seller is alive or until he attains a particular age.

Capital and Revenue Receipts in Relation To Business Activities
Profits and gains arising from the various transactions which are entered into in the ordinary course of the
business of the tax payers or those which are incidental to or closely associated with his business would be
revenue receipts chargeable to tax.
Examples of these type of receipts are:
– profits on purchase and sale of shares by a share broker on his own account;
– profits arising from dealings in foreign exchange by a banker or other financial institutions,
– income from letting out buildings owned by a company to its employees etc.
But even in these cases the receipts may be of a capital nature in certain circumstances.
For instance, profit on sale of shares and securities held by a bank as investments would be of a capital nature.
Where profits arise from transactions which are outside the normal dealing of the assessee, although connected
with his business, the taxable nature or otherwise of the profits would depend upon the fact whether or not the
transaction(s) in question constitute(s) trading activity.

Examples of differentiation between Revenue Receipts and Capital Receipts
1. Taxable income in relation to Annuities
Annuities are periodic payments of specified amounts at regular intervals of time. Annuities are revenue receipts
taxable as income in every case although the payment of the annuity involves the conversion of capital into
income. The contingent or variable nature of the annuity, its amount, periodicity, mode of payment etc. do not, in
any way, affect the taxability of the annuity. An annuity received by an employee from his present or previous
employer would be taxable as his income from salaries while all other annuities are taxable as income from other

Lesson 1

Introduction and Important Definitions

11

sources. Although annuities are generally annual payments, every annual payment does not represent an annuity.
For instance annual instalments of capital payments do not constitute annuities. Thus, when a person sells his
business or property and agrees to receive the consideration in instalments annually or half-yearly, the amounts
received by him are merely capital sums received in instalments and are, therefore, not taxable as annuities. But if
the same property is sold for an annuity payable at regular intervals immediately on sale the property disappears
and the right to get annuity takes place; the annuities received by virtue of the right acquired on sale would be
taxable as income.
On the other hand, a lump sum payment received in commutation of salaries or pension, even though a capital
receipt, would be taxable as salary income. Similarly, any amount received under a policy of insurance would be
a revenue receipt if the policy was held by the assessee as a trading asset whereas it would be a capital receipt
if the policy was held as a capital asset.
2. Taxable income vis-a-vis Compensation
Compensation for termination of a sole selling agency is a capital receipt although it is taxable as business income
by virtue of the specific provision in Section 28 of the Act, but if an assessee has many agencies and one of them
is terminated, the compensation received by the assessee would be a revenue receipt; the fact that it is taxable as
business income even otherwise does not convert the character of the receipt from revenue to capital. The
compensation received for restraint of trade or profession is a capital receipt since it is received in replacement of
the source of income itself. But this principle does not apply to cases where the restraint of trade or profession is
incidental to (and is not the primary purpose) the agreement between the parties. For instance, non-practising
allowance received by a doctor from his employer as an integral part of the terms of employment would be taxable
as his salary income since it does not represent a capital receipt. Therefore, the taxability of compensation in all
cases would depend upon whether it is received in replacement of the main source of income itself or in replacement
of the income. If it is the former, it is a capital receipt; in the latter case, it would be revenue.
3. Taxable income vis-a-vis Subsidies and grants
Subsidies and grants received from the government would generally be receipts of a revenue nature since they
are intended to supplement the income of the assessee. But in cases where the grant is received for a specific
purpose but not as a supplementary trading receipt it would be a capital receipt not taxable as income. For
instance, if a company is given grant to undertake work to relieve unemployment or to promote family planning
the grant being received for a specific purpose would constitute capital receipt exempt from tax.
4. Taxable income vis-a-vis debenture
For debenture holder the premium on redemption or the discount on issue of the debentures by the company
would be a capital receipt and would not consequently be liable to tax. In the case of the issuing company also,
the premium or discount on the issues of shares and debentures or on their redemptions would be on capital
account. But the discount on loans advanced at a discount and repayable at a premium would be a revenue
receipt in the hands of a person whose business is that of money-lending if the loans had been advanced in the
ordinary course of the assesses business without taking any extra commercial consideration as the cases. In all
other cases, such a discount would be on capital account. However, the premium (salami) - a single payment
made for the acquisition by the lessee of the right to occupy and enjoy the benefits granted to him under the
lease of any land, building or other capital asset is normally a capital receipt since the rights acquired or given
under the lease by virtue of the payment of salami constitute a capital asset. But if the premium takes the
character of advance rent (instead of the price paid for parting with and giving possession of the capital asset)
the receipt would be taxable as income.
5. Taxable income vis-a-vis Royalties
Royalties in every case are taxable as income from other sources; it is immaterial whether they are received in
lump sum or as fixed annual sum or otherwise; the basis of computation of the royalties would be equally

12 EP-TL&P
immaterial. The taxability of the royalty does not also depend upon the nature of the asset the use of which gives
rise to the royalty; the asset may be a patent, copyright, goodwill, technical know-how, secret formula or process
and so on. If, however, the receipt is in consideration of the assignment, sale or surrender of the patent, copyright,
etc. (but not the use thereof) the owner of the asset would cease to be its owner as soon as the assignment, sale
or surrender takes place and therefore, the receipt would constitute a capital receipt.
6. Taxable income vis-a-vis Devaluation in foreign currency
Profit arising from devaluation of a currency or dealings in foreign exchange and that attributable to the normal
fluctuations in the rate of exchange of currencies would be receipts of a revenue nature taxable as income in
cases where the foreign currencies are held as stock in trade by the assessee (e.g. a bank or a dealer in the
foreign exchange). Where the foreign currencies are held as capital assets representing the assesses investments
the profit or loss would be on capital account.

Exceptions where capital receipt are taxable
Although the general principle of law is to tax only revenue receipts as income, there are three exceptions to this
rule under which capital receipts are also taxable as income, viz.:
(i) Any compensation received for termination of employment or modification of the terms of employment
would fall within the meaning of a profit in lieu of salary and consequently taxable as salary income.
[Section 17(3)(i)]
(ii) Any compensation received for termination of managing agency or other contractual relationship in
relation to the management of whole or substantially the whole of the affairs of a company or the
modification of the terms and conditions relating thereto would be taxable as income from business.
[Section 28(ii)(a and b)]
(iii) Any compensation or other payment due to or received by any person for the termination or the modification
of the terms of any other agency held by him in India in relation to the business of any other person would
also be taxable as income from business regardless of the nature of the agency business. [Section 28(ii)(c)].

Factors that do not determine the nature or character of receipt
The capital or revenue nature of a receipt must be determined with reference to each receipt on the basis of the
facts and circumstances of each case, the ultimate conclusion as to the capital or revenue character of the
receipt would be of the High Court or the Supreme Court and the principles laid down by the Court must be
followed for the purpose. However, while determining the question whether a particular receipt is capital or
revenue in nature, care must be taken to ensure that the following are not taken as the basis for determination
although these factors may, to a certain extent, be helpful to arrive at the conclusion:
(i) Character and source of income
The nature of receipt should be decided entirely on the basis of its character in the hands of the recipient,
the source from which the payment has been received being immaterial for the purpose. For instance,
there may be cases where the payer makes the payment out of capital while the recipient gets it as
income. This may happen in a case where there is a businessman who deals in plant and machinery;
while the purchaser of the machinery would pay the price out of his capital, the seller would get it as
income from business. Therefore, the taxability of the receipt does not depend upon the character of
payment in the hands of the payer.
(ii) Application of income
The application of the income after its receipt by the recipient is immaterial for purposes of taxability.
(iii) Allowance or disallowance of the amount to the payer
The payment may represent expenditure in the hands of the payer and in certain cases may be disallowed

Lesson 1

Introduction and Important Definitions

13

in computing the taxable income of the payer. But the disallowance in the payer’s hands would not in
any way affect the taxability of the entire amount of remuneration in the employees or directors hands
although there may be double taxation of the same amount in two hands for the same period. Thus, the
allowance or disallowance of the amount to the payer is immaterial for taxing the recipient.
(iv) Treatment given in the books
The name by which the payment is called by the parties concerned and the treatment given to it in the
books of accounts of the parties would also be irrelevant. For instance, every item of income from
employment is taxable as salary income whether it is called salary, wages, bonus, pension, and annuity
or by any other name. In other words, it is only the real character of the receipt and not what the parties
call it that would determine its taxability.
(v) Magnitude and method of payment
The quantum of the payment, whether it is paid in installments or in lump sum and also whether it is paid
at regular intervals of time or otherwise and even the magnitude of the payment are not the factors that
determine the capital or revenue character of the receipt for tax purpose.
(vi) Basis for measurement of the receipt
The basis for measurement of the receipt (a specified percentage of the estimated profit taken as the
basis for measuring damages) should not be taken as the deciding factor for determining the capital or
revenue character of the receipt.
(vii) Ways or devices resorted by payer
The various devices resorted to by tax payers in arranging their financial affairs do not also conclusively
establish the nature of the receipt because a tax payer is legally entitled to arrange his affairs in such a way
as to reduce his tax burden to the minimum. In the light of the aforesaid principles the capital or revenue
nature of the receipt should be first determined before proceeding to compute the taxable income.
Illustration:
State whether the following are capital or revenue receipts/expenses and give your reasons:
1. AB & Co. received ` 2,00,000 as compensation from CD & Co. for premature termination of contract of
agency.
2. Sales-tax collected from the buyer of goods.
3. PQ Company Ltd. instead of receiving royalty year by year, received it in advance in lump sum.
4. An amount of ` 1,50,000 was spent by a company for sending its production manager abroad to study
new methods of production.
5. Payment of ` 50,000 as compensation for cancellation of a contract for the purchase of machinery with
a view to avoid an unnecessary expenditure.
6. An employee director of a company was paid ` 1,75,000 as a lump sum consideration for not resigning
from the directorship.
Solution
1. Receipt in substitution of a source of income is a capital receipt. Therefore, the amount received by AB
& Co. from CD & Co. for premature termination of an agency contract is a capital receipt though the
same is taxable under Section 28(ii)(c).
2. Sales-tax is the liability of a seller to pay to the Government on the sale of goods made by him, which is
allowed as deduction as revenue expenditure. If any part of Sales-tax is collected from the buyer of
goods that may be treated as a revenue receipt. Thus the sales-tax collected from the buyer of goods is
a revenue receipt.

14 EP-TL&P
3. Receipt of lump sum royalty in lieu of future royalties is a revenue receipt, as it is an income from
royalty.
4. Amount spent by a company for sending its production manager abroad to study new methods of
production is a revenue expenditure to be allowed as a deduction. Because the new knowledge and
exposure of that manager will assist the company in improving its existing methods of production etc.
5. This is a capital expenditure, as any expenditure incurred by a person to free himself from a capital
liability is a capital expenditure. In the given case, the payment of ` 50,000 for cancelling the order for
purchase of the machinery, has helped the assessee to become free from an unnecessary capital
liability.
6. The amount of ` 1,75,000 received for not resigning from the directorship is a reward received from the
employer. Therefore it is a revenue receipt.

COMPUTATION OF TAXABLE INCOME AND TAX LIABILITY OF AN ASSESSEE
Income tax is a charge on the assessee’s income. Income Tax law lays down the provisions for computing the taxable
income on which tax is to be charged. Taxable income of an assessee shall be calculated in the following manner:
1. Determine the residential status of the person as per section 6 of the Act.
2. Calculate the income as per the provisions of respective heads of income. Section 14 classifies the
income under five heads:
(i) Income from salaries
(ii) Income from House Property
(iii) Profits and gains of business or Profession
(iv) Capital Gains
(v) Income from other sources
3. Consider all the deductions and allowances given under the respective heads before arriving at the net
under each head.
4. Exclude the income exempt under section 10 of the Act.
5. Aggregate of incomes computed under the 5 heads of income after applying clubbing provisions and
making adjustments of set off and carry forward of losses is known as Gross Total Income.
6. Deduct therefrom the deductions admissible under Sections 80C to 80U. The balance is called Total income.
7. The total income is rounded off to the nearest multiple of Rupees ten. (Section 288A)
8. Add agriculture income (if any) in the total income calculated in (6) above. Then calculate tax on the
aggregate as if such aggregate income is the Total Income.
9. Calculate income tax on the net agricultural income as increased by ` 2,50,000/3,00,000/5,00,000 as
the case may be, as if such increased net agricultural income were the total income.

10. The amount of income tax determined under (9) above will be deducted from the amount of income tax
determined under (8) above.
11. Calculate income tax on capital gains under Section 112, and on other income at specified rates.
12. The balance of amount of income tax left as per (10) above plus the amount of income tax at (11) above
will be the income tax in respect of the total income.
13. Deduct the following from the amount of tax calculated under (12) above:
– Rebate under section 87A (if applicable).
– Tax deducted and collected at source.
– Advance tax paid.
– Double taxation relief (Section 90 or 91).
14. The balance of amount left after deduction of items given in (13) above, shall be the net tax payable or
net tax refundable for the assessee. Net tax payable/refundable shall be rounded off to the nearest
multiple of Ten rupees (Section 288B).
15. Along with the amount of net tax payable, the assessee shall have to pay penalties or fines, if any,
imposed on him under the Income-tax Act.

LESSON ROUND UP
– Tax is the financial charge imposed by the Government on income, commodity or activity. Government
imposes two types of taxes namely Direct taxes and Indirect taxes. Direct tax is one where burden of
tax is directly on the payer. While Indirect tax is paid by the person other than the person who utilizes
the product or service.
– The Income tax Act contains the provisions for determination of taxable income, determination of tax
liability, procedure for assessment, appeal, penalties and prosecutions.
– Every year a Budget is presented before the parliament by the Finance Minister. One of the important
components of the Budget is the Finance Bill. The Bill contains various amendments such as the rates
of income tax and other taxes. When the Finance Bill is approved by both the houses of parliament
and receives the assent of President, it becomes the Finance Act.
– To levy income tax, one must have the understanding of the various concepts related to the charge of
tax like previous year, assessment year, Income, total income, person etc.
– Income: No precise definition of the word ‘Income’ is available under the Income-tax Act, 1961. The
definition of Income as given in Section 2(24) of the Act starts with the word includes therefore the list
is inclusive not exhaustive.
– Assessee: In common parlance every tax payer is an assessee. However, the word assessee has
been defined in Section 2(7) of the Act according to which assessee means a person by whom any tax
or any other sum of money (i.e. interest, penalty etc.) is payable under the Act.
– Person: Income-tax is charged in respect of the total income of the previous year of every person.
Hence, it is important to know the definition of the word person.
– Assessment year means the period of twelve months commencing on 1st April every year.
– Previous year: Income earned in a year is taxable in the next year. The year in which income is
earned is known as previous year.
– Computation of income: Income tax is a charge on the assessee’s income. Income Tax law lays
down the provisions for computing the taxable income on which tax is to be charged.

Basis of Charge, Scope of Total Income
and Residential Status
LESSON OUTLINE

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

– Charge of Income Tax (Section 4)

Income tax is levied on the taxable income of
every person. For calculation of income tax,
taxable income is the basis. To determine taxable
income, residential status of the person and
scope of total income are the initial steps. There
are two types of taxpayers from residential point
of view – Resident in India and Non-resident in
India. Sourced based income in India is taxable
in India whether the person earning income is
resident or non-resident. Conversely, foreign
sourced income of a person is taxable in India
only if such person is resident in India. Therefore,
the determination of the residential status of a
person is very significant in order to find out his
tax liability.

– Tax incident vis-a-vis residential status

The basis for determination of residential status
varies from person to person. For instance,
residential status of an individual and HUF
depend upon the physical stay in India, while
that of a corporate depends upon the places of
its effective management in previous year.

– Lesson Round Up

At the end ot this Lesson, you will –

– Self Test Questions

– Be able to determine the residential status
of a person
– Be aware of the importance of residential
status for tax purposes
– Understand the scope of total income.

The residential status of the assessee is to be determined each year with reference to the “previous
year”. The residential status of the assessee may change from year to year. What is essential is the
status during the previous year and not in the assessment year. Moreover, the concept of residential
status is nothing to do with nationality or domicile of a person. An Indian, who is a citizen of India,
can be non-resident for Income Tax purposes, whereas a foreigner can be resident of India for
Income Tax purpose.

22 EP-TL&P

CHARGE OF INCOME-TAX (SECTION 4)
Section 4 of the Act is the charging section. A section in a Act, which imposes a charge is referred to as a
charging section and a section merely providing rules for working out the charge so imposed is referred to as a
machinery section. It lays down the basis on which tax is imposed.
Accordingly, this section provides that:
Where any Central Act enacts that income-tax shall be charged for any assessment year at any rate or rates,
income-tax at that rate or those rates shall be charged for that year in accordance with, and subject to the
provisions (including provisions for the levy of additional income-tax) of, this Act in respect of the total income of
the previous year of every person :
Provided that where by virtue of any provision of this Act income-tax is to be charged in respect of the income
of a period other than the previous year, income-tax shall be charged accordingly.
Further, in respect of income chargeable under sub-section (1), income-tax shall be deducted at the source or
paid in advance, where it is so deductible or payable under any provision of this Act.
(a) income-tax shall be charged at the rate or rates prescribed in the Finance Act for the relevant previous
year; (discussed in 1st lesson)
(b) the charge of tax is on various persons specified in Section 2(31) (definition of persons, discussed in 1st
lesson);
(c) the income sought to be taxed is that of the previous year and not of the of assessment year; and
(d) the levy of tax on the assessee is on his total or taxable income computed in accordance with and
subject to the appropriate provisions of the Income-tax Act, including provisions for the levy of additional
income-tax.

RESIDENTIAL STATUS AND TAX LIABILITY (SECTION 6)
Total income of an assessee cannot be computed unless the person’s residential status in India during the
previous year is known. According to the residential status, the assessee can either be;
(i) Resident in India or
(ii) Non-resident in India
However, individual and HUF cannot be simply called resident in India. If individual or HUF is a resident in India,
they will be either be :
(a) Resident and Ordinarily resident in India (ROR) or
(b) Resident but not Ordinarily resident in India (RNOR).
In case of persons other than individual and HUF, the residential status will be either resident in India or nonresident in India.
Section 6 of the Income-tax Act prescribes the tests to be applied to determine the residential status of all tax
payers for purposes of income-tax. These are to be applied to determine residential status of for individuals,
companies. Hindu Undivided Families and firms, associations of persons, bodies of individuals and artificial juridical
persons.
An assessee’s residential status must be determined with reference to the previous year in respect of which the
income is sought to be taxed (and not with reference to the assessment year).

TEST FOR RESIDENCE OF INDIVIDUAL
Basic Condition for a person to be Resident
Under Section 6(1) of the Income-tax Act, an individual is said to be resident in India in any previous year if he:
(a) is in India in the previous year for a period or periods amounting in all to one hundred and eighty-two
days or more i.e., he has been in India for at least 182 days during the previous year; or,
(b) has been in India for at least three hundred and sixty-five days (365 days) during the four years preceding
the previous year and has been in India for at least sixty days (60 days) during the previous year.
Exception to the basic condition
In the case of following individual –
(a) being a citizen of India, who leaves India in any previous year as a member of the crew of an Indian ship
as defined in clause (18) of section 3 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 (44 of 1958), or for the
purposes of employment outside India,
(b) being a citizen of India, or a person of Indian origin within the meaning of Explanation to clause (e)
of section 115C, who, being outside India, comes on a visit to India in any previous year,
The provisions of the second condition shall apply in relation to that year as if for the words “sixty days (60
days)”, occurring therein, the words “one hundred and eighty-two days (182 days) “ had been substituted.
A person is deemed to be of Indian origin if he, or either of his parents or any of his grandparents, was born
in Undivided India. It may be noted that grandparents include both maternal and paternal grand parents.
Non-Resident
If an individual does not satisfy any of the above basic condition then, he will be treated as Non-Resident. It must
be noted that the fulfillment of any one of the above conditions (a) or (b) as applicable will make an individual
resident in India for tax purposes. Further it is to be noted that these conditions are alternative and not cumulative
in their application.
Resident and Ordinary Resident (ROR)
An individual may become a resident and ordinarily resident in India if he satisfy both the following conditions
given u/s 6(1)besides satisfying any one of the above mentioned conditions:
(i) he is a resident in atleast any two out of the ten previous years immediately preceding the relevant
previous year, and
(ii) he has been in India for 730 days or more during the seven previous years immediately preceding the
relevant previous year.
Resident and Not Ordinary Resident (RNOR)
An individual is not ordinarily resident in any previous year if –
(a) he has been a non-resident in India in nine out of the ten previous years preceding that year, or
(b) he has during the seven previous years preceding that year been in India for a period of, or periods amounting
in all to, seven hundred and twenty-nine days (729 days) or less.
Important Points
(i) The fact that an assessee is resident in India in respect of one year does not automatically mean that he
would be resident in the preceding or succeeding years as well. Consequently, the residential status of the
assessee should be determined for each year separately. This is in view of the fact that a person resident in one
year may become non-resident or not ordinarily resident in another year and vice versa.

24 EP-TL&P
(ii) It must also be noted that the residential status of an individual for tax purposes is neither based upon nor
determined by his citizenship, nationality and place of birth or domicile. This is because of the fact that, for tax
purposes, an individual may be resident in more than one country in respect of the same year.
(iii) The common feature in both the above conditions is the stay of the individual in India for a specified period.
The period of stay required in each of the conditions need not necessarily be continuous or consecutive nor it is
stipulated that the stay should be at the usual place of residence, business or employment of the individual.
Purpose of stay is immaterial in determining the residential status.
(iv) The stay may be anywhere in India and for any length of time at each place in cases where the stay in India
is at more places than one, what is required is the total period of stay should not be less than the number of days
specified in each condition.
(v) Steps to solve residential status of an Individual:
– Step 1: Determine whether the individual falls under exception to basic condition;
– Step 2: If yes, apply only first basic condition, if satisfied, then he will be resident otherwise non-resident.
If no, then apply both basic conditions and Individual becomes Resident on satisfaction of any one of
the conditions.
– Step 3: Check if satisfy the test of ‘Ordinary Resident’, if yes, then he will be called ROR, otherwise he
will be called RNOR.
(vi) India means territory of India, its territorial waters, continental shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone (upto 200
nautical miles) and airspace above its territory and territorial waters.
(vii) Where the exact arrival and departure time is not available then the day he comes to India and the day he
leaves India is counted as stay in India.

Mr. P has stayed in India for 237 (viz. 25 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 28 + 31) days in the previous year 2016-17.
So, this test is satisfied.
So, Mr. P shall be a resident in India during the previous year 2016-17. (Assessment year 2017-18).
Keeping in view the facts of the given case, Mr. P satisfies the two additional conditions also namely:

Solution:
Dr. Z being a citizen of India and who has gone out of the country for employment, will be governed by 182 days
test only and therefore the second condition under section 6(1), i.e. 60 days during relevant previous year shall
not be applicable.

26 EP-TL&P
Dr. Z stayed in India for 168 (viz. 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 15) days only in the relevant previous year.

The following facts are now available:
(i) Stay of Mr. P during the previous year 2016-17 is 185 days.
(ii) Mr. P is resident in India in two out of ten previous years preceding the relevant previous year (viz.
resident in 2015-16 on satisfaction of 2nd Basic Condition and resident in 2014-15 on satisfaction of 1st
Basic Condition).
(iii) Stay of Mr. P in India is also more than 730 days in 7 previous years preceding the relevant previous year.
Hence, Mr. P shall be a resident and ordinary resident for the assessment year 2017-18.
Illustration 4
Mr. B is a foreign citizen. His father was born in Delhi in 1960 and mother was born in England in 1965. His
grandfather was born in Delhi in 1935. Mr. A is coming to India to see Taj Mahal and visit other historical places
in India. He comes to India on 1st November, 2016 for 200 days. He has never come to India before. Determine
his residential status for AY 2017-18.
Solution:
Mr. B falls in exception to basic conditions as he is a Person of Indian Origin (as his grandfather was born in
undivided India) and he comes on a visit to India during relevant Previous year. Therefore, only first basic
condition of 182 days during relevant previous year would be checked.
Stay during relevant PY 2016-17 = 1st Nov, 2016 to 31st March, 2017 = 30+31+31+28+31 = 151 days
Mr. B is Non-resident in India for PY 2016-17 as he does not satisfy first basic condition.

TESTS OF RESIDENCE FOR HINDU UNDIVIDED FAMILIES, FIRMS AND OTHER ASSOCIATIONS
OF PERSONS
The test to be applied to determine the residential status of a HUF, Firm or other Association of Persons is based
upon the control and management of the affairs of the assessee concerned. The tests based on the period of
stay in India applicable to individuals cannot be applied to these assessees for obvious reasons.
Meaning of place of control and management:
The expression control and management refers to the functions of decision-making and issuing directions
but not the places where from the business is carried on.
In other words, the Control and Management means taking policy decisions relating to business. Policy
decisions are concerning finance, marketing, production, advertising, personnel etc. It does not mean day to
day operations of the concern/assessee. The control and management is situated at that place where policy
decisions are taken.
– Control and Management of HUF: It is with Karta or its Manager.
– Control and Management of Firm/AOP: It is with Partners/Members.
A HUF, firm or other association of persons is said to be resident in India within the meaning of Section 6(2) in
any previous year, if during that year the control and management of its affairs is situated wholly or partly in
India. If the control and management of its affairs is situated wholly outside India during the relevant previous
year, it is considered non resident.
A HUF can be “not ordinarily resident”
If manager/karta has been a not ordinarily resident in India in the previous year in accordance with the tests
applicable to individuals. Where, during the last ten years the kartas of the H.U.F. had been different from one

28 EP-TL&P
another, the total period of stay of successive kartas of the same family should be aggregated to determine the
residential status of the karta and consequently the H.U.F.
In other words, if Karta of Resident HUF satisfies both the following additional conditions (as applicable in case
of Individual) then Resident HUF will be ROR, otherwise it will be RNOR:
Additional Conditions :
(1) Karta of Resident HUF should be resident in atleast 2 previous years out of 10 previous year immediately
preceding relevant previous year.
(2) Stay of Karta during 7 previous year immediately preceding relevant previous year should be 730 days
or more.
Note:
It is immaterial whether Karta is Resident or Non-Resident during relevant previous year, for the purpose of
determining whether HUF is ROR or RNOR. If Karta satisfies both the additional conditions, then HUF will be
ROR, otherwise RNOR.
Firms, association of persons, local authorities and other artificial juridical persons can be either resident
(ordinarily resident) or non-resident in India but they cannot be not ordinarily resident in India.
IMPORTANT POINTS
– Even if negligible portion of the control and management of the affairs is exercised from India, it will be
sufficient to make the family, firm or the association resident in India for tax purposes. For instance, if the
affairs of a firm are controlled partly from India and partly from Bangladesh, the firm would be resident in
India.
– While the control and management of the affairs of the firm or family would necessarily be exercised by
the partners of the firm or members of the family, the residential status of the members or partners is
generally irrelevant for determining the residential status of the firm or family. But in cases where the
residential status of the partners materially affects or determines the place of control and management
of the affairs of the firm, the residential status of the member or partners should also be taken into
account in determining the residential status of the firm or the family.
– The mere fact that all the partners are resident in India does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that
the firm is resident in India because there may be cases where even though the partners are resident in
India, control and management of the affairs of the firm is exercised from outside India.
– A Hindu Undivided Family would generally be presumed to be resident in India unless the assessee
proves to the tax authorities that the control and management of its affairs is situated wholly outside
India during the relevant accounting year.
HUF, Firm or Association of
Persons (AOP)

If during that the previous year the control
and management of its affairs is situated

AY 2017-18 (a) if Karta is ROR in India for that year (b) If Karta is NR in India but he satisfies both the additional
conditions (c) If Karta is RNOR in India.
Solution:
HUF would be Resident in India as Control and Management is wholly situated in India.Determination of whether
HUF is ROR or RNOR:
(a) HUF is ROR in India as Karta would be satisfying both the additional conditions (because he is ROR).
(b) HUF is ROR in India as Karta is satisfying both the additional conditions. Karta’s residential status
during relevant previous year (i.e. resident/non-resident) is irrelevant.
(c) HUF is RNOR as Karta does not satisfy both the additional conditions.

AB & Co. is a partnership firm whose operations are carried out in India. However, all meetings of partners
take place outside India as all the partners are settled abroad. Determine Residential status of firm for AY
2017-18.
Solution:
AB & Co. is Non-Resident in India during relevant previous year as Control and Management (place where
policy decisions are taken, here it is the place where meetings are held) is wholly situated outside India.

TESTS OF RESIDENCE FOR COMPANIES
All Indian companies within the meaning of Section 2(26) of the Act are always resident in India regardless of the
place of control and management of its affairs.
In the case of a foreign company the place of control and management of its affairs is the basis on which the
company’s residential status is determinable.
Accordingly a company shall be said to be resident in India in any previous year, if –
(i) it is an Indian company; or
(ii) the control and management of its affairs is wholly situated in India.
It must be noted that only an individual or a HUF can be resident, not ordinarily resident or
non-resident in India. All other assesses can be either resident or non-resident in India but
cannot be not ordinarily resident in the matter of their residential status for all purposes of income
tax.
The assessment should, in every case, be made in accordance with the provisions of the law in force in the
relevant assessment year and not the law applicable to the previous year.
Note: The Finance Act, 2015 amended the above provision so as to provide that a company would be resident
in India in any previous year if it is an Indian company or its Place of Effective Management (POEM) in that year
is in India. The POEM was defined to mean a place where key management and commercial decisions that are
necessary for the conduct of the business of an entity as a whole are in substance made.

However, POEM based residence test has been deferred by one year vide Amendment in Finance Act, 2016
and the determination of residence based on POEM shall be applicable from 01/04/17.

MEANING AND SCOPE OF TOTAL INCOME (SECTION 5)
Section 4 of the Act imposes a charge of tax on the total or taxable income of the assessee. The meaning and
scope of the expression of total income is contained in Section 5. The total income of an assessee cannot be
determined unless we know the residential status in India during the previous year. The scope of total income
and consequently the liability to income-tax also depends upon the following facts:
(a) whether the income accrues or is received in India or outside,
(b) the exact place and point of time at which the accrual or receipt of income takes place, and
(c) the residential status of the assessee.

Scope of Total income has been defined on the basis of Residential status
(A) Resident and Ordinarily Resident Assessee
According to Sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Act the total income of a resident and ordinarily resident assessee
would consist of:
(i) income received or deemed to be received in India during the accounting year by or on behalf of such
person;
(ii) income which accrues or arises or is deemed to accrue or arise to him in India during the accounting
year;
(iii) income which accrues or arises to him outside India during the accounting year.
It is important to note that under clause (iii) only income accruing or arising outside India is included. Income
deemed to accrue or arise outside India is not includible.
(B) Resident but Not Ordinarily Resident In India
Proviso to section (1) of section 5 the total income in case of resident but not ordinarily resident in India
(i) income received or deemed to be received in India during the accounting year by or on behalf of such person;
(ii) income which accrues or arises or is deemed to accrue or arise to him in India during the accounting year;
(iii) income which accrues or arises to him outside India during the previous year if it is derived from a
business controlled in or a profession set up in India.
(C) Non-Resident
Sub-section (2) of Section 5 provides that the total income of a non-resident would comprise of:
(i) income received or deemed to be received in India in the accounting year by or on behalf of such person;
(ii) income which accrues or arises or is deemed to accrue or arise to him in India during the previous year.
Explanation 1. – Income accruing or arising outside India shall not be deemed to be received in India within the
meaning of this section by reason only of the fact that it is taken into account in a balance sheet prepared in
India.
Explanation 2. – For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that income which has been included in the
total income of a person on the basis that it has accrued or arisen or is deemed to have accrued or arisen to him
shall not again be so included on the basis that it is received or deemed to be received by him in India.

Place and date of receipt of income
The place and date of receipt of income are two important factors for levying tax. When the amount is received
in cash and directly from the debtor, there is no difficulty in deciding the place and date of receipt. But when the
payment is made by cheque or by post, the place and date of receipt is determined as follows:
(i) Date of receipt when receipt is by cheque
If the payment is made by the drawee on presentment of the cheque, the date of receipt of the cheque and not
the date of its encashment shall be the date of receipt.
(ii) Place of receipt when payment is made by cheque and by post
In this case, if the Post Office is the agent of the creditor, the place of posting by the debtor shall be regarded as
the place of receipt by the creditor. If, on the other hand, there is no specific understanding that the payment is
to be made by post, the place of receipt by the creditor would be the place of receipt.
(iii) Place of receipt when receipt is through a Postal Money Order, or by Insured Post
In this case, the place of receipt is to be determined on the basis of who (creditor or debtor) bears the postal
expenses. If the postal expenses are borne by the creditor, the place of debtor would be place of receipt. If, on
the other hand, the debtor bears the postal expenses, the place of creditor would be the place of receipt.
(iv) Date and place of receipt in case of articles sent by V.P.P.
In this case the place of the delivery by the Post Office would be the place of receipt and the date of receipt
would be the date of payment by the buyer.
(v) Payment by transfer of immovable property
Whenever any immovable property is accepted in satisfaction of a claim, the date of receipt would not be the
date when possession is given but the date of receipt would be when a conveyance is executed.
(vi) Issuing receipt in advance
When a receipt is issued in advance but the payment is not received during the accounting year, it cannot be
treated as receipt during the accounting year when the receipt is issued.

Income received in India
Income received in India is taxable regardless of the assessee residential status therefore it has great significance.
(i) The receipt contemplated for this purpose refers to the first receipt of the amount in question as the
income of the assessee.
For instance, if A receives his salary at Delhi and sends the same to his father, the salary income of A is
a receipt for tax purposes only in the hands of A; his father cannot also be said to have received income
when he receives a part of the income of A. In the hands of A’s father it is only a receipt of a sum of
money but not a receipt of income.
(ii) Method of Accounting: Although receipt of income is not the sole test of its taxability, the receipt of
income would be the primary basis for determining the taxability of the amount in cases where the
assessee follows the cash system of accounting; however, where the assessee follows the mercantile
system of accounting the income would become taxable as the income of the accounting year in which
it falls due to the assessee regardless of the date or place of its actual receipt.
(iii) While considering the receipt of income for tax purposes both the place and the date of its receipt
must be taken into account. The income in question should be not only received during the accounting
year relevant to the assessment year but must also be received in India in order to constitute the

32 EP-TL&P
basis of taxation. Thus, if an item of income is first received outside India and after a few years is
brought into India the subsequent receipt of the same amount in India should not be taken as the
basis of taxing the same since the same income cannot be received twice and it will be known as
Remittances.
(iv) For the purpose of taxation both actual and constructive receipt must be taken into account. Receipt by
some other person on behalf of the assessee should be treated as receipt by the assessee for being
taxed in his hands.
(v) The question of taxability of a particular income received by the assessee depends upon the nature of
income. For instance, income from salaries and interest on securities would attract liability to tax
immediately when it falls due to the assessee regardless of its actual receipt by or on behalf of the
assessee.

Income deemed to be received in India
In addition to the income actually received by the assessee or on his behalf, certain other incomes not actually
received by the assessee and/or not received during the relevant previous year, are also included in his total
income for income tax purposes. Such incomes are known as income deemed to be received. Some of the
examples of such income are:
(i) All sums deducted by way of taxes at source (Section 198).
(ii) Incomes of other persons which are included in the income of the assessee under Sections 60 to 64.
(iii) The amount of unexplained or unrecorded investments (Section 69).
(iv) The amount of unexplained or unrecorded moneys, etc. (Section 69A).
(v) The annual accretion in the previous year to the balance standing at the credit of an employee participating
in a Recognised Provident fund to the extent provided in Rule 6 of Part A of the Fourth Schedule
[Section 7(i)]. The contributions made by the employer to Recognised Provident Fund in excess of 12%
of the employees salary and the interest credited to the Provident Fund account of the employee in
excess of the prescribed rate shall be included in the salary income of the employee. This amount is
known as annual accretion.
(vi) The transferred balance in a Recognised Provident Fund to the extent provided in Rule 11(4) of Part A
- Fourth Schedule [Section 7(ii)].
When provident fund is recognised for the first time in a particular year, the existing balance to the credit
of an employee on the date of recognition, which is carried into the recognised provident fund, is called
the transferred balance. The amount of the transferred balance, less the employees own contributions
included therein, is deemed to be the income of the year in which recognition takes place. The amount
contributed by the employer to the provident fund and the interest on his contribution is included in the
income under the head Salaries and the interest on the contributions made by the employee is included
in the income under the head “Income from other sources”.
(vii) Any dividend declared by a Company or distributed or paid by it within the meaning of Section 2(22)
[Section 8(a)].
(viii) Any interim dividend unconditionally made available by the Company to the member who is entitled to it
[Section 8(b)].
(ix) The Supreme Court verdict in Standard Triumph Motor Co. Ltd. v. CIT (1993) 201 ITR 391, seems to
have made the lot of non-residents in particular more vulnerable. The Court in that case held that a
credit entry in the books of the buyer of goods or services in favour of the supplier of goods or services
tantamount to receipt of money by the latter. By equating credit entry with receipt itself the judgment

Lesson 2

Basis of Charge, Scope of Total Income and Residential Status

33

exposes non-residents to Indian tax liability where they were not all along liable on the basis of mere
credit entry. Because a resident is in any case liable to tax on his world income and therefore this
judgment affects a non-resident more than it affects a resident.

Income accrued in India
The accrual of income is different and distinct from the receipt of income discussed above. Sometimes in the
context of accrual or arisal the word earned is used. A person may be said to have earned his income in the
sense that he has contributed to the production by rendering of goods or services. But in order that the income
may be said to have accrued to him, an additional element is necessary, that is, he must have created a debt in
his favour. Income is said to accrue when it comes into existence for the first time or at the point of time when the
right to receive the income arises although the right may be exercised or exercisable at a future date. Income is
said to be received when it reaches the assessee. When the right to receive the income becomes vested in the
assessee, it is said to accrue or arise.
Income is said to accrue only to that person who is lawfully entitled to that income. Income accrues at the place
where the source of the income is situated, which may or may not be the same as the place from which the
business activities are carried on. Normally, income accrues at the place where the contract yielding the income
is entered into and for this purpose the contract should be taken to have been entered into at the place where
the offer is accepted.
As already stated, the total income in the case of any non-resident assessee consists of:
(a) income received or deemed to be received in India, regardless of the place of its accrual, and
(b) income which accrues or is deemed to accrue in India regardless of the place of its receipt. Thus, the
accrual of income as the basis of taxation is more important in the case of non-residents than all other
classes of assessees. Accordingly, a non-resident partner of a resident partnership firm carrying on its
business outside India is taxable in India on the entire amount of his share of the firms income from its
foreign business; such a partner cannot claim tax exemption in respect of even a part of his share of the
firms income corresponding to the firms foreign income. This is because of the fact that, so far as the
partner is concerned, the source of his income (i.e., his share in firms profits) is situated in India (as the
firm is resident in India) and the income consequently arises in India.

Income deemed to accrue or arise in India
According to section 9 of the Act, certain incomes are deemed to accrue or arise in India which are discussed
below:
(a) Income by virtue of business connection
– Income arising through or from business connection to any assessee is deemed to accrue or arise in
India where a business connection actually exists whether with or without a regular agency, branch or
other type of commercial association.
– For purposes of deeming income to accrue or arise in India, the expression ‘business connection’ must
be taken to have wider scope that what is commonly understood by it. It is entirely different from the
carrying on of a business although business connection may have some direct or indirect relationship
with the business carried on.
– The Supreme Court has held that business does not necessarily mean trade or manufacture only, it is
being used as including within its scope professions, vocations and callings [Barendra Prasad Ray and
Others v. I.T.O. (1981) ITR, p. 295].
– If income accrues to any person outside India by virtue of his business connection in India, whether
directly or indirectly, that income must be deemed to accrue or arise in India for purposes of income-tax
assessment.

34 EP-TL&P
– In cases where all the operations or activities of a business are not carried on in India but a part of them
arise by virtue of the business connection in India, the income which is deemed to accrue or arise in
India, should be taken to be only that part which could reasonably by attributed to the operations carried
on in India. Rule 10 of the Income-tax Rules contains the basis on which the income attributable to the
operations carried out in India could be deemed to accrue or arise in India.
– However, where a substantial part of a non-residents output is sold in the Indian market through brokers
to various customers in India, or mere rendering of services outside India to a person carrying on
business in India does not amount to a business connection in India.
– Similarly, where an Indian exporter selling goods through non-resident selling agents, receives sale
price in India, credits commission on sales to non-resident agents in his books of account and remits the
amount to them later, such commission to non-residents is neither received or deemed to be received in
India nor deemed to accrue or arise in India [C.I.T. v. Toshoku Ltd. (1980) 125 ITR p. 525 (S.C.)].
THE MEANING OF THE EXPRESSION ‘BUSINESS CONNECTION’
The expression business connection includes:
(i) the maintenance of a branch office, factory, agency, receivership, management or other establishment
for the purchase or sale of goods or for transacting any other business;
(ii) the erection of a factory where the raw products purchased locally are processed or converted into
some form suitable for export outside India;
(iii) appointing an agent or agents in India for the systematic and regular purchase of raw materials or
other commodities or for the sale of the non-residents goods, or for any other purpose;
(iv) the formation of a close financial association between a resident and a non-resident company which
may or may not be related to one another as a holding and subsidiary company;
(v) the formation of a subsidiary company to sell or otherwise deal with the products of the non-resident
parent company;
(vi) the grant of a continuing licence to a non-resident for the purpose of exploitation for profit of an asset
belonging to the non-resident even though the transaction in question may be treated as an out and
out sale by the parties concerned.
No Business connection in India in following cases of Non-Resident.
(1) Tax Exemption for encouraging Export :
– For the purpose of encouraging exports, a specific tax concession has been given by providing that no
income shall be deemed to accrue or arise in India to a non-resident through or from his operations
which are confined to the purchase of goods in India for the purpose of export.
– This exemption is available to a non- resident even though he keeps an office agency for the purpose of
buying and export. This exemption is, however, not available to residents or not ordinarily residents.
– In order to qualify for tax exemption, it is essential that the operations of the non- residents, although
arising from business connection, should be confined to the purchase of goods for the purpose of
export outside India.
– Consequently, the exemption would not be available if the goods purchased in India are sold in India or
are not exported outside India.
– Further, if the non-resident works up the raw-materials into finished or semi-finished products, the
exemption would be withdrawn and he would become chargeable on such portion of the profits as is
attributable to his manufacturing it in India.

(2) Operations confined to collection of news and views for transmission outside India by or on behalf of Non
Resident who is engaged in the business of running news agency or of publishing newspapers, magazines or
journals;
(3) Operations confined to shooting of cinematograph films in India if such Non-Resident is:
(a) an Individual – he should not be a citizen of India; or
(b) a firm – the firm should not have any partner who is a citizen of India or who is resident in India; or
(c) a company – the company does not have any shareholder who is a citizen of India or who is resident in
India
(b) Income arising from any asset or property in India:
– Income arising in a foreign country from any property situated in India would be deemed to accrue or
arise in India.
– In this context, the term property does not refer to house property alone but it refers to all tangible
properties whether movable or immovable. For instance, the rent or hire charges for the use of buildings
or machinery of the assessee which, under an agreement are payable only outside India, would be
deemed to accrue or arise in India.
– Income arising through or from any asset or source of income in India would also be deemed to accrue
or arise in India.
– In this context, the term source means not a legal concept but something which a practical man would
regard as a real source of income.
– The term property does not refer to the property dealt with by Sections 22 and 23, but it includes any
tangible movable or immovable property. The term asset would, however, include all intangible rights
and, consequently, interests, dividends, patents and copyrights, royalties, rents etc. will be an Income
from assets.
(c) Capital asset:
– Capital gains arising to an assessee from the transfer of a capital asset situated in India would be
deemed to accrue or arise in India irrespective of the fact whether the capital asset in question represents
a movable or immovable property or a tangible or intangible asset.
– It is also immaterial whether the consideration for the transfer of the capital asset is actually paid or
payable in India or outside.
– The place of registration of the document of transfer of property is equally immaterial.
– However, if the capital asset, prior to the transfer, is situated outside India, the provisions of Section 9(1)
would not apply to deem the capital gains arising on the transfer as accruing or arising in India for
purposes of its taxation in India.
(d) Income from salaries
– Income which is chargeable under the head Salaries is deemed to accrue or arise in India in all cases
when earned in India. For this purpose income is said to be earned in India if the services are rendered
in India.
– The actual place of accrual of the salaries, the residential status of the employer, the citizenship or
nationality of the employee and whether the employee is a Government servant or an employee of
private enterprise are immaterial.
– However, under Sub-section (2) of Section 9, any pension payable outside India to a person residing

36 EP-TL&P
permanently outside India should not be deemed to accrue or arise in India if the pension is payable to
civil servants and retired judges provided they were appointed before the 15th August, 1947 and continued
to serve after the constitution came into operation.
– Barring this exception, non-residents and not ordinarily residents entitled to receive salary or pension
earned by them in India would be deemed to receive income which has accrued in India even though
the income may be actually accruing and received outside India.
– Income from salaries payable by the Government to a citizen of India outside India for his services
rendered outside India, is deemed to accrue or arise in India even though the income is actually accruing
outside India and is also received outside India. Thus, under this provision, salary income of all
Government servants, working outside India is deemed to accrue in India. In the absence of this provision
they would not be chargeable to tax in respect of such income as they would, after some time, become
non-residents.
– This provision to deem income as accruing in India applies only in respect of their income from salary
but not in respect of the allowances and perquisites to which they are entitled to while serving in a
foreign country.
– Section 10(7) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 contains a specific provision to exempt Government servants
from tax on their services in a foreign country partly to meet the higher cost of living in that country.
– Salaries paid by the Indian Government in a foreign country to citizens of the foreign country should not,
however, be deemed to accrue in India since this provision applies only to Indian citizens employed by
the Government who are rendering service outside India.
(e) Taxability of Interest: Interest payable in following cases will be deemed to accrue or arise in India and will
be taxable in the hands of recipient irrespective of his residential status (i.e. ROR, RNOR or NR).
Interest payable by:
(i) Government; or
(ii) A Resident in India, except where interest is payable in respect of moneys borrowed and used for the
purpose of business or profession carried outside India or earning any income from any source outside
India (i.e. Interest payable by a Resident for loan used in India for any purpose, whether for business or
profession or otherwise);
(iii) A Non-Resident in India provided interest is payable in respect of moneys borrowed and used for a
business or profession carried on in India (i.e. Interest payable by a Non-Resident for loan used for only
business or profession in India)
(f) Taxability of Royalty: Royalty payable in following cases will be deemed to accrue or arise in India and will
be taxable in the hands of recipient irrespective of his residential status (i.e. ROR, RNOR or NR).
Royalty payable by:
(i) Government; or
(ii) A Resident in India except where it is payable in respect of any right/information/property used for the
purpose of a business or profession carried on outside India or earning any income from any source
outside India (i.e. Royalty payable by a Resident for right/information/property used for any purpose in
India whether business or profession or for earning other incomes);
(iii) A Non-Resident in India provided royalty is payable in respect of any right/information/property used for
the purpose of the business or profession carried on in India or earning any income from any source in

Lesson 2

Basis of Charge, Scope of Total Income and Residential Status

37

India (i.e. Royalty payable by a Non-Resident for right/information/property used for any purpose in
India whether business or profession or for earning other incomes)
(g) Taxability of Fees for Technical Services: Fees for technical services payable in following cases will be
deemed to accrue or arise in India and will be taxable in the hands of recipient irrespective of his residential
status (i.e. ROR, RNOR or NR).
Fees for technical services payable by:
(i) Government; or
(ii) A Resident in India except where services are utilized for the purpose of a business or profession
carried on outside India or earning any income from any source outside India (i.e. Fees for technical
services payable by a Resident for services utilised for any purpose in India whether business or
profession or for earning other incomes);
(iii) A Non-Resident in India provided fee is payable in respect of services for the purpose of a business or
profession carried on in India or earning any income from any source in India (i.e. Fees for technical
services payable by a Resident for services utilised for any purpose in India whether business or
profession or for earning other incomes);
(h) Taxability of Dividend :
– Dividend paid by any Indian company outside India is deemed to accrue or arise in India and the income
is consequently chargeable to income-tax irrespective of the fact whether the dividend is interim dividend
or a final dividend and whether it is an actual dividend or a notional dividend.
– The place of declaration of the dividend is immaterial and the date of payment is equally immaterial for
deeming the income to accrue in India.
– Normally, dividend income arises at the place where the source of income is situated, i.e., where the
shares yielding the income are kept. Shares are said to be situated at the place where the share register
of the company is kept. While the share register of a company should ordinarily be kept at the place
where its registered office is located, even if the share register is kept outside India and the dividends
are declared outside India, the dividend would still be deemed to accrue in India because the company
is an Indian company. It is another matter that dividend paid/payable by Indian companies has been
exempted vide Section 10(34) with the introduction of the system of distribution tax which has shifted
the incidence of tax on dividend to the company from the shareholder.
– Dividends declared by foreign companies outside India would not, however, be deemed to accrue or
arise in India even in cases where the foreign company is resident in India because of the control and
management of its affairs being situated wholly in India.
– In order to deem the dividend income as arising in India, the residential status of the shareholder
as also the status of the assessee, whether he is an individual, company or local authority, are
irrelevant.

Apportionment of income betw een spouses governed by Portuguese civil code
(Section 5A)
Where the husband and wife are governed by the system of community of property (known under the Portuguese
Civil Code of 1860 as COMMUNIAO DOS BENS) in force in the state of Goa and the Union territories of Dadra
and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, the income under each head of income (other than under the head
salaries) shall be apportioned equally between the husband and the wife and such income shall not be assessed
as that of the community of property whether treated as an association of persons or as a body of individuals).
Under this provision, even the income from profession will be apportioned equally between the husband and
wife. However, in the case of salary income, it will be assessed in the hands of the spouse who has actually
earned it. After the income has been apportioned in the aforesaid manner, it will be included separately in the
total income of the husband and the wife respectively, and the remaining provisions of the income-tax shall
apply accordingly.

The above table depicts that the first four incomes are chargeable to tax in India in respect of all assesses,
irrespective of their residential status. In the case of a resident or resident and ordinarily resident assessee, tax
incidence is the highest as income accruing in any part of the world attracts tax incidence in India. The tax
incidence, on the other hand, is the lowest in the case of non-resident as only such income as accrued or is
received or deemed to be received in India is liable to tax.
In respect of incomes which are deemed to accrue or arise in India, it is immaterial as to who the assessee is
or what the nature or status of the assesse’s position in India. Since income which is deemed to accrue or
arise in India is taxable in the hands of all assesses regardless of their residential status, nationality, citizenship,
place of birth, the domicile or business. However, the above table has a major role in determining the tax
incidence in case of non- residents and also in cases where the income is actually accruing or arising outside
India.

LESSON ROUND UP
– Total income of an assessee cannot be computed unless the person’s residential status in India during
the previous year is known. According to the residential status, the assessee can either be;
(i) Resident in India or
(ii) Non-resident in India
– Section 6 of the Income-tax Act prescribes the tests to be applied to determine the residential status of
all tax payers for purposes of income-tax. There are three alternative tests to be applied for individuals,
two for companies and Hindu Undivided Families and firms, associations of persons, bodies of
individuals and artificial juridical persons.

Lesson 2

Basis of Charge, Scope of Total Income and Residential Status

43

– Residential status of Individual: The residential status of individual is determined on the basis of the
following conditions:
(i) Condition 1: If individual is in India in the previous year for a total period of 182 days or more.
(ii) Condition 2: If he has been in India for at least 365 days during the 4 years preceding the previous
year and has been in India for at least 60 days during the previous year. However, the clause of 60
days is not applicable if a person is :
– Citizen of India, who leaves India in any previous year as a member of the crew of an Indian
ship, or for the purpose of employment outside India. OR
Citizen of India or of Indian origin engaged outside India (whether for rendering service outside
or not) and who comes on a visit to India in the any previous year.
(iii) Condition 3: An individual who has been a non-resident in India in at least nine out of the ten
previous years preceding that year, and has during the seven previous years preceding that year
been in India for a period of, or periods amounting in all to 729 days or less.
Resident and Ordinarily Resident – Satisfies either condition 1 or 2; But doesnot satifies condition 3
Not ordinarily resident – Satisfies any one condition from 1 & 2 and condition 3
Non-resident – Does not satisfy any condition from 1 and 2
– Residential status of HUF: The test to be applied to determine the residential status of a HUF, Firm or
other Association of Persons is based upon the control and management of the affairs of the assessee
concerned. A HUF, firm or other association of persons is said to be resident in India within the meaning
of Section 6(2) in any previous year, if during that year the control and management of its affairs is
situated wholly or partly in India during the relevant previous year. If the control and management of its
affairs is situated wholly outside India during the relevant previous year, it is considered non resident.
– A HUF can be “not ordinarily resident”
– If manager/karta has been a not ordinarily resident in India in the previous year in accordance with the
tests applicable to individuals.
– Firms, association of persons, local authorities and other artificial juridical persons can be either resident
(ordinarily resident) or non-resident in India but they cannot be not ordinarily resident in India.
– Residential status of Companies: All Indian companies within the meaning of Section 2(26) of the Act
are always resident in India regardless of the place of control and management of its affairs.
In the case of a foreign company the place of effective management (POEM) of the affairs is the basis
on which the company’s residential status is determinable. The concept of POEM has been introduced
vide Finance Act, 2015.
– Basis of charge: Section 4 of the Act is the charging section which imposes a charge and provides
rules for working out the charge so imposed.
Section 4 of the Act imposes a charge of tax on the total or taxable income of the assessee. The
meaning and scope of the expression of total income is contained in Section 5. The total income of an
assessee cannot determined unless we know the residential status in India during the previous year.
The scope of total income and consequently the liability to income-tax also depends upon the following
facts:

44 EP-TL&P

previous year. For providing relief to the tax
payers from payment of tax, income tax law
provisions contains concept of exemption and
deduction. Exempted income means the income

exempted from levy of income tax for example
Scholarship. Further, deduction means the
amount which needs to be included in the
income first and then they are allowed for
deduction in full or in part on fulfillment of certain
conditions. For example, deduction for payment
of donations under section 80G.

48 EP-TL&P

GENERAL EXEMPTION
Under Section 10 of the Income-tax Act, various items of income are totally exempt from income-tax. Therefore,
these incomes are not included in the total income of an assessee.
Section 10 provides that in computing the total income of a previous year of any person, any income falls in its
ambit shall not be included in the total income, provided the assessee proves that a particular item of income is
exempt and falls within a particular clause. The onus is on the assessee i.e. the assssee has to prove that his
income falls under Section 10.
The items of ‘exemptions’ specified in Section 10, are explained as follows:

AGRICULTURAL INCOME [SECTION 10(1)]
Agricultural income as defined in Section 2(1A) is exempt from income-tax in the case of all assesses. This
exemption has been granted on account of the constitutional provisions relating to the powers of the Central and
the State Governments for levying tax on agricultural income.
Under the Constitution only the State Governments are empowered to levy tax on agricultural income. Hence,
the Central Government while imposing income-tax on incomes of various types has specifically excluded
agricultural income from the purview of Central income-tax. This exemption would, however, be available only in
cases where the income in question constitutes agricultural income within the meaning of Section 2(1A).

Definition of Agricultural Income
As per section 2(1A) of the Act, agricultural income is defined as follows:
Agricultural income means –
(a) Any rent or revenue derived from land which is situated in India and is used for agricultural purposes;
(b) Any income derived from such land by –
(i) agriculture; or
(ii) the performance by a cultivator or receiver of rent-in-kind of any process ordinarily employed by a
cultivator or receiver of rent-in-kind to render the produce raised or received by him fit to be taken to
market; or
(iii) the sale by a cultivator or receiver of rent-in-kind of the produce raised or received by him, in
respect of which no process has been performed other than a process of the nature described in
paragraph (ii) of this sub-clause ;
(c) Any income derived from any building owned and occupied by the receiver of the rent or revenue of any
such land, or occupied by the cultivator or the receiver of rent-in-kind, of any land with respect to which, or
the produce of which, any process mentioned in paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of sub-clause (b) is carried on:
Provided that –
(i) the building is on or in the immediate vicinity of the land, and is a building which the receiver of the rent
or revenue or the cultivator, or the receiver of rent-in-kind, by reason of his connection with the land,
requires as a dwelling house, or as a store-house, or other out-building, and
(ii) the land is either assessed to land revenue in India or is subject to a local rate assessed and collected
by officers of the Government as such or where the land is not so assessed to land revenue or subject
to a local rate, it is not situated –
(A) in any area which is comprised within the jurisdiction of a municipality (whether known as a
municipality, municipal corporation, notified area committee, town area committee, town committee

Lesson 3

Incomes which do not Form Part of Total Income

49

or by any other name) or a cantonment board and which has a population of not less than ten
thousand ; or
(B) in any area within the distance, measured aerially,—
(I) not being more than two kilometres, from the local limits of any municipality or cantonment board referred
to in item (A) and which has a population of more than ten thousand but not exceeding one lakh; or
(II) not being more than six kilometres, from the local limits of any municipality or cantonment board
referred to in item (A) and which has a population of more than one lakh but not exceeding ten lakh; or
(III) not being more than eight kilometres, from the local limits of any municipality or cantonment board
referred to in item (A) and which has a population of more than ten lakh.
Explanation 1. – For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that revenue derived from land shall not include
and shall be deemed never to have included any income arising from the transfer of any land referred to in item
(a) or item (b) of sub-clause (iii) of clause (14) of this section.
Explanation 2. – For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that income derived from any building or land
referred to in sub-clause (c) arising from the use of such building or land for any purpose (including letting for
residential purpose or for the purpose of any business or profession) other than agriculture falling under subclause (a) or sub-clause (b) shall not be agricultural income.
Explanation 3. – For the purposes of this clause, any income derived from saplings or seedlings grown in a
nursery shall be deemed to be agricultural income.
Explanation 4. – For the purposes of clause (ii) of the proviso to sub-clause (c), “population” means the population
according to the last preceding census of which the relevant figures have been published before the first day of
the previous year;

Conditions to be satisfied for Agricultural Income
According to the definition of Agricultural Income as per Section 2(1A) of the Act, the income which satisfies
following conditions is treated as agricultural income.
(a) Rent or revenue derived from land:
– The word rent denotes the payment of money either in cash or in kind by one person to another (owner
of the land) in respect of grant of right to use land.
– The recipient of rent or revenue should be the owner of the land.
– The expression revenue is used in the broader sense of return, yield or income, and not in the sense of
land revenue.
– Income is said to be derived from land only if the land is the immediate and effective source of the
income and not the secondary and indirect source. Thus interest on arrears of rent payable in respect of
agricultural land is not agricultural income because the source of income (interest) is not from land but
it is from rent which is a secondary source of income and is taxable under the head Income from other
sources. [CIT v. Kamakshya Narain Singh [(1948) 16 ITR 325].
(b) Land must be situated in India:
Land must be situated in India but it is immaterial whether the agricultural land in question has been assessed
to land revenue or local taxes assessed and collected by the Officers of the Government in India.
(c) Land must be used for agricultural purpose:
The land must be used for agricultural purposes. There must be some measure of cultivation on the land, some
expenditure of skill and labour upon it, to have been used for agricultural purposes within the meaning of the Act.
[Mustafa Ali Khan v. CIT (16 ITR 330)]. Also, the land is said to be used for agricultural purposes where the
following two types of operations are being carried on [CIT v. Raja Benoy Kumar Sahas Roy (1957) 32 ITR 466]

50 EP-TL&P
(i) Basic operation:
These include tilling of the land, sowing of seeds, planting or an operation of a similar kind (digging pits
in the soil to plant a sapling).
(ii) Subsequent operations:
These include weeding, digging the soil around the growth, nursing, pruning, cutting, Protection of
Crops from insects and pets etc.
If the person has performed the basic operations on
the land whether he has performed the subsequent
operations or not.

The income shall be agricultural income. For
example: Seller of standing crops, who has put in
labour and skill to make the crop sprout out of the
land, is agricultural income.

If the person has not performed the basic operations
on the land but he has performed the only subsequent
operations

The income shall not be agricultural income for him
and it will be taxable under the head Business/
Profession. For example: If a person purchases a
standing crop, and makes a profit out of it, the income
is not agricultural income

Note: Here agriculture connotes all the products of vegetable kingdom (food for human beings and animals,
fruits, commercial crops, flowers, medicines, bamboo, timber, fuel material) but it does not include the products
of animal kingdom (dairy farming, butter and cheese making, poultry farming, breeding of live stock etc.).

Concept of Agricultural Income
Agricultural Income means and includes
I. Rent received from the land used for agricultural purposes [section 2(1A)(a)]:
When a person (landlord or tenant) lets out a piece of land, which is situated in India, for agricultural
purposes, the rent received either in cash or kind from the tenant is considered as agricultural income.
II. Revenue income derived from agriculture
When the landlord or tenant cultivates the farm, raises the product and sells it or appropriates it for his
individual needs, the difference between the cost and selling price (including the value of self consumption
on the basis of average market rate for the year) is the income derived from agriculture.
III. Income from making the produce fit to be taken to market
The crop as harvested might not find a market. If, in order to make the product a saleable commodity,
the cultivator or receiver of rent-in-kind performs some operation (manual or mechanical) and enhances
the value of the produce, the enhancement of value of the produce is also agriculture income. Such
income to be regarded as agricultural income, the following conditions must be satisfied:
(i) The operation must be one which is ordinarily employed by the cultivator to make the produce fit for
market, i.e., threshing, winnowing, cleaning, drying, etc.
(ii) There is no market (ready and willing and not a theoretical market) for the produce as received from
the farm.
(iii) The process to make it marketable has been performed either by the cultivator or receiver of rent-inkind.
(iv) The produce must not change its original character.
Example:
(a) There is no ready market for raw coffee in the green state. It has to be dried-up and cured before it
can be sold. In the same way, the conversion of the green tobacco leaves into fluecured tobacco is

Lesson 3

Incomes which do not Form Part of Total Income

51

a must before sale. On the other hand, there is a ready market of kapas or unginned cotton. If the
farmer sells the ginned cotton, the additional income (difference between the selling price of ginned
cotton and unginned cotton) is not agricultural income and is therefore liable to tax.
(b) Similarly, where a farmer grew mulberry leaves and fed the same to silk-worm, it was not a process
employed by the cultivator of mulberry leaves to make them marketable by way of producing silk
cocoons, and the income derived from rearing of silk-worms was not agricultural income because
the silk cocoons produced by silk-worms did not bear any character of an agricultural produce or as
a marketable form of mulberry leaves. [K. Lakshmansa & Co. v. CIT (1981) 128 ITR, p. 283 (Kar.)].
IV. Income from sale of produce:
When the cultivator or receiver of rent-in-kind sells the produce either after performing certain activities
to make it fit for market (discussed in III above) or without doing any such activity, the income is agricultural
income. It is immaterial that he has sold the produce to the wholesaler in the market or through his own
retail shop directly to the consumers.
V. Income from Building:
In the following cases the income from building or house property is treated as agricultural income:
(a) (i) If the land-lord receives rent in cash, it is owned and occupied by him; or
(ii) If the land-lord receives rent-in-kind, it is occupied by him -whether owned or not; or
(iii) if it is occupied by the cultivator - whether owned by him or not;
(b) If it is on or in the immediate vicinity of the agricultural land;
(c) If it is required as a dwelling-house or as a store house or as an out-house by the land-lord or
cultivator;
(d) If it is required by reason of the land-lords or cultivators connection with the land, i.e., either the
building is required to make the produce fit to be taken to the market or there is a sufficient quantity
of produce which requires a store house or there are numerous tenants and it is necessary to stay
there to collect the rent or it is necessary for the cultivator to be there to look after the farm.
(e) (i) The land is assessed to land revenue in India; or
(ii) The land is subject to land revenue or local rate assessed and collected by the officers of the
Government - either Central or State for the benefit of local bodies. Where the land is not so assessed,
the building should not be situated:
(a) in an area of municipality (whether known as Municipal Corporation, Notified Area Committee,
Town Area Committee, or by any other name or Cantonment Board whose population according
to the latest census figures published is 10,000 or more; or
(b) in a notified area within such limits of a Municipality, etc., as may be notified by Government.
However, the distance of notified area cannot exceed 8 kilometres from the local limits. The department
has issued various circulars from time to time specifying the notified areas.
VI. Ownership of Land is not essential:
In the case of rent or revenue, it is essential that the assessee has an interest in the land (as an owner or a
mortgagee) to be eligible for tax-free income. However, in the case of agricultural operations, it is not necessary
that the cultivator be the owner of the land. He could be a tenant or a sub-tenant. In other words, all tillers of land
are agriculturists and enjoy exemption from tax. In certain cases, further processes may be necessary to make
a commodity marketable out of agricultural produce. The sales proceeds in such cases are considered agricultural
income because the producer’s final objective is to sell his products.

52 EP-TL&P

Income Connected with Land but not Agricultural Income
There are certain incomes which are derived from land but that are not agricultural incomes because the requisite
conditions - land must be used for agricultural purposes and it must be the primary source of income - are not
satisfied in such cases. Some of the examples of such incomes are as follows:

(b) Dividend from a company engaged in agriculture;
(c) Salary of a farm manager;
(d) Income from mines;
(e) Income from stone quarries;

As per Rule 7 of the Income-Tax Rules, 1962, in the case of income which is partially agricultural income as
defined in section 2 and partially income chargeable to income-tax under the head “Profits and gains of business”,
in determining that part which is chargeable to income-tax the market value of any agricultural produce which
has been raised by the assessee or received by him as rent-in-kind and which has been utilized as a raw
material in such business or the sale receipts of which are included in the accounts of the business shall be
deducted, and no further deduction shall be made in respect of any expenditure incurred by the assessee as a
cultivator or receiver of rent-in-kind. For this purpose “market value” shall be deemed to be: –
(a) where agricultural produce is ordinarily sold in the market in its raw state, or after application to it of any
process ordinarily employed by a cultivator or receiver of rent-in-kind to render it fit to be taken to
market, the value calculated according to the average price at which it has been so sold during the
relevant previous year;
(b) where agricultural produce is not ordinarily sold in the market in its raw state or after application to it of
any process aforesaid, the aggregate of –
(i) the expenses of cultivation;
(ii) the land revenue or rent paid for the area in which it was grown; and
(iii) such amount as the Assessing Officer finds, having regard to all the circumstances in each case, to
represent a reasonable profit.
For example, if a sugar mill has its own farm and the sugarcane grown on the farm has been utilized in the
factory, the average market price of the sugarcane shall be deducted from the sale proceeds of sugar while
computing the taxable income from business.

crepe) or technically specified block rubbers manufactured or processed from field latex or coagulum
obtained from rubber plants grown by the seller in India shall be computed as if it were income derived
from business, and thirty-five percent of such income shall be deemed to be income liable to tax.
(2) In computing such income, an allowance shall be made in respect of the cost of planting rubber plants
in replacement of plants that have died or become permanently useless in an area already planted, if
such area has not previously been abandoned, and for the purpose of determining such cost, no deduction
shall be made in respect of the amount of any subsidy which, under the provisions of clause (31) of
Section 10, is not includible in the total income.

Income from the manufacture of coffee (Rule 7B)
(1) Income derived from the sale of coffee grown and manufactured by the seller in India, with or without

Treatment of Agricultural Income and Non-Agricultural Income
Partial Integration:
– The Finance (No. 2) Act, 1977 has introduced certain modifications in computation of tax payable where

54 EP-TL&P
the assessee (being an individual, association of persons or body of individuals) has both agricultural
income and non-agricultural income.
– For the first time Finance Act, 1973 introduced the scheme of inclusion of agricultural income in the total
income for the limited purpose of determining the amount of tax payable on the non-agricultural income.
– The scheme applies only to those assessees (being an individual, association of persons or body of
individuals) who have simultaneously net agricultural income exceeding ` 5,000 and taxable nonagricultural income i.e.non agricultural income exceeds the basis exemption limit of ` 2,50,000 or `
3,00,000 or ` 5,00,000 the case may be.

Determination of Tax Liability
While determining the tax-liability, due consideration is to be given to the following rules to arrive at the tax on
non-agricultural income:
1. Compute the net agricultural income as if it were income chargeable to income-tax under the head:
“Income from other sources”.
2. Aggregate agricultural and non-agricultural income of the assessee and calculate income-tax on the
aggregate income as if such aggregate income were the total income.
3. Increase the net agricultural income by the first slab of income on which tax is charged at nil rate and
calculate income-tax on net agricultural income, so increased, as if such income were the total income
of the assessee.
4. The amount of income-tax determined at (2) will be reduced by the amount of income-tax determined at (3).
5. The amount so arrived at will be the total income-tax payable by the assessee.
From the amount of tax determined as above, the following tax reliefs/tax rebates are deductible:
– Rebate under Section 86 in respect of share of profit from an association of persons.
– Relief under Section 90/91 in respect of doubly taxed income.
– Rebate under Section 87(A) if applicable.
The sum so arrived at will be the income-tax in respect of the total income.
Illustration 1:
A resident individual is having following income :
Non-agricultural income ` 2,50,000. Net agricultural income ` 40,000.
Solution:
No income-tax payable as the non-agricultural income does not exceed ` 2,50,000.
Illustration 2:
A resident individual below the age of 60 years is having following income :
Non-agricultural income ` 2,52,000. Net agricultural income ` 40,000.
Solution:
`
Step 1 :

Non-agricultural income + Net Agricultural income
Income-tax thereon 10% (2,92,000-2,50,000)

Step 2 :

Net agricultural income as increased by exemption limit (` 40,000 + 2,50,000)
Income-tax thereon 10% (` 2,90,000 – 2,50,000)

2,92,000
4,200
2,90,000

Step 3 :

Deduct tax arrived at in step 2 from tax arrived at in step 1 (` 4,200 – ` 4,000)
to arrive at tax payable.

is wholly exempt from tax under Section 10(10)(i) of the Act.
The payment of gratuity by the Life Insurance Corporation of India under the Staff Regulations is wholly exempt
from tax under Section 10(10), as the object and purpose of the gratuity scheme of the Life Insurance Corporation
of India and the Revised Pension Rules of the Central Government are the same.
Illustration: Mr. Y, an employee of the Central Government, receives ` 2,00,000 as gratuity at the time of his
retirement on May 1, 2016 under the new pension code. Determine the taxability of the gratuity in his hands
for the assessment year 2017-18. In case he joins a private sector company on July 1, 2016 as its Managing
Director, will it make any difference?
Solution: Gratuity received by Mr. A shall be fully exempt from tax under Section 10(10)(i) of the Income-tax
Act, 1961 as he is an employee of Central Government. Even if he joins a private sector company after the
retirement, the aforesaid exemption shall still be available to him.
Conditions based Exemption
(i) Where the employees are covered under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972:

60 EP-TL&P
The amount of any gratuity received under The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, it shall be exempt from tax to the
extent of least of the following:
(a) fifteen days’ wages (seven days’ wages in case of seasonal establishments) for each completed year of
service or part thereof in excess of six months on the basis of salary last drawn for every completed year
of service or part thereof in excess of six months; or
(b) the gratuity actually received; or
(c) ` 10,00,000 (limit raised by notification no.43/2010 dt.11-06-2010)
Important Notes
(i) “Wages” means all emoluments which are earned by an employee while on duty or on leave in accordance
with the terms and conditions of his employment and which are paid or are payable to him in cash and include
dearness allowance but do not include any bonus, commission, house rent allowance, overtime wages and any
other allowance.
(ii) The Supreme Court has held that wages of fifteen days or seven days, as the case may be, will be
calculated by dividing the wages last drawn by 26, i.e. maximum number of working days in a month
[Digvijay Woollen Mills Ltd. v. Mahendra Prataparai Buch (1980) 4 Taxman 15].
Illustration
Mr. B is employed in a non-seasonal factory at a salary of ` 2,400 P.M. Besides, he also gets dearness
allowance @ ` 600 P.M. and bonus @ ` 200 P.M. He retires on December 31, 2016 and gets ` 75,000 as
gratuity under the Payment of Gratuity Act after serving 31 years and 4 months in that factory. Compute the
amount of gratuity which is exempt under the Income-tax Act, 1961.
Solution
In this case 31 years shall be taken as completed years of service.
Monthly salary = ` (2,400 + 600) = ` 3,000
15 days’ salary is ` 1,730.77 (i.e. ` 3,000 x 15 ÷ 26)
Out of ` 75,000 received as gratuity, the least of the following will be exempt from tax:
(i) ` 53,654 (being 15 days salary for each completed year of service i.e. ` 1,730.77 x 31);
(ii) ` 10,00,000; or
(iii) ` 75,000 (being gratuity actually received).
Hence, ` 53,654 being the least, is exempt from tax and the balance ` 21,346 is taxable for the assessment
year 2017-18.
Note : Bonus is not included in salary but Dearness Allowance is included
(ii) Where the employees are not covered under the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972:
The amount of any other gratuity received by the employee from a private employer (not covered under the
Payment of Gravity Act, 1972) on his retirement or at the termination of his employment or on his becoming
incapacitated or received by the employee’s nominee on the former’s death, to the extent it does not, in either
case,
(i) exceed 1/2 month’s salary for each year of completed service, calculated on the basis of the average
salary for the ten months immediately preceding the month in which any such event occurs, or

Lesson 3

Incomes which do not Form Part of Total Income

61

(ii) ten lakhs rupees* or
(iii) gratuity actually received Where gratuities are received by the employee from more than one employer
in the same previous year, the aggregate amount exempt from income-tax under (c) shall not exceed
`10,00,000.*
Important Notes:
(i) Where any gratuity/gratuities was/were received in any one or more earlier previous years also and the whole
or any part of the amount of such gratuity was not included in the total income of the assessee, the limit of `
10,00,000* will be reduced by the amount of gratuity which has been exempted earlier.
(ii) ‘Salary’ includes dearness allowance, if the terms of employment so provide, but excludes all other allowances
and perquisites. Where an employee receives dearness pay, it shall be included in the salary.
(iii) The Supreme Court has held that if under the terms of employment, commission is payable at a fixed
percentage of turnover achieved by the employee such commission would partake of the character of ‘Salary’.
Therefore, salary will be basic salary, dearness allowance (forming part of salary for retirement benefits) and
percentage commission.
(iv) “Year” means the calendar year commencing from the 1st of January and ending on the 31st December.
“Each year of completed service” means a period of twelve months’ service rendered by the employee, reckoned
from the date on which he joined service with his employer.
Illustration
Mr. C, who is not covered by the Payment of Gratuity Act, received a gratuity of ` 90,000 on retirement on
December 31, 2016 after serving 35 years (forms part of salary for retirement benefits) and 8 months. His last
drawn emoluments were: Basic salary ` 4,000 p.m. Dearness allowance ` 1,000 p.m. Annual increment of `
200 p.m. falls due on 1st October each year. Determine the amount of gratuity exempt from tax for the
assessment year 2017-18.
Solution:
In this case 35 years shall be taken as completed years of service.
Average salary shall be computed as under:
Basic salary and D.A. drawn by him during:
(i) Before annual increment February 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016 @ ` 4,800
(i.e. ` 3,800 + ` 1,000) x 8 months =

Clause 10AA of Section 10 grants the following exemptions on this account:
(i) Any payment received by an employee of the Central Government or a State Government as the cash
equivalent of leave salary in respect of the period of earned leave at the employee’s credit only at the
time of retirement whether such retirement is on superannuation or otherwise. The effect of this clause

chargeable to tax except, when such payments are made at retirement and qualify for exemption under
Section 10(10AA) of the Act.
(ii) Any payment as encashment of earned leave received from any other employer is exempt to the extent
of:
For non-government employees (including employees of local authority or statutory corporation), least

Section 10(10AA) shall be ` 3,00,000.
(iv) The amount of leave encashment actually received at the time of retirement.
Notes: (a) If the employee had received leave encashment in any one or more earlier previous year(s) also and
had availed of the exemption in respect of such amount, then the limit in (iii) above, shall be reduced by the
amount of exemption(s) availed earlier.
(b) Where the leave encashment is received by the employee from more than one employer in the same previous
year, the specified limit in (iii) above would apply to the aggregate of leave encashment received from one or
more employers.
(c) Leave salary received by the family of a government servant, who died in harness, is not taxable in the hands
of the recipient. [Circular No. 309, dated 3.7.1981]

new terms and conditions of service are less favourable to him; or the new employer is, under the terms of
transfer or otherwise legally not liable to pay to the workman, in the event of his retrenchment, compensation on
the basis that his service has been continuous and has not been interrupted by the transfer. “Wages”, in the
context of Section 10(10B), means:
– all remuneration capable of being expressed in terms of money, which would be payable to a workman
in respect of employment or of work done in such employment, if the terms of employment, express or
implied, were fulfilled.
– “Wages” also include (i) such allowances, including DA as the workman is entitled to; (ii) the

in respect of such excess.

One month salary due from Y Ltd. during 2016-17 is received by him in April 2017. He pays ` 3,000 per
month as house rent through out the previous year. Determine the amount of house rent allowance chargeable
to tax for the assessment year 2017-18.
Solution:
X Ltd.: House rent allowance, exempt from tax, shall be the least of the following:
(i) ` 2,200 per month (being 40% of salary i.e. ` 5,000 + ` 500);
(ii) ` 1,000 per month (being the actual HRA);
(iii) ` 2,450 per month [Being the excess of rent paid over 10% of salary i.e. ` (3,000 – 550) per month].
` 1,000 per month, being the least shall be exempt from tax.

Note: The exemption in respect of HRA is based upon the following factors:
(1) Basic Salary
(2) Place of Residence
(3) Rent paid
(4) HRA received
Since, there is a possibility of change in any of the above factors during the previous year, exemption for HRA
should not always be calculated on annual basis. As long as there is no change in any of the above factors it can
be calculated together for that period. Whenever there is a change in any of the above factors, it should be
separately calculated till the next change.

SPECIAL ALLOWANCE [SECTION 10(14)]
(a) Any special allowance in cash or the value of any benefit granted by the employer to an employee with the
specific object of enabling the employee to meet expenses ‘wholly’, ‘necessarily’ and ‘exclusively’ incurred by him
in the performance of the duties of his office or employment of profit, is exempt from tax to the extent to which such
expenses are actually incurred for that purpose. This allowance may include travelling allowance to agents,
conveyance allowance, transfer allowance, etc., but it does not include entertainment allowance, perquisites and
the allowance to meet personal expenses (i.e. City Compensatory Allowance) at the place where the duties of office
are performed by him or at the place where he ordinarily resides [Addl. C.I.T. v. A.K. Mishra 117 ITR 342 (All.)].

70 EP-TL&P
It must be noted that to be eligible for exemption the amount must have been actually expended. Where a
surplus remains in the hands of the assessee out of a lump sum paid to him by the employer for the purpose, the
surplus would be taxable in the hands of the assessee as income. This is irrespective of the fact that the
employer does not demand refund of the amount not expended [CIT v. Tejaji Farasram Kharawalla Ltd. (1968)
67 ITR 95 (SC)].
(b) The allowances granted to the assessee to meet his personal expenses at the place where the duties of his
office or employment of profit are ordinarily performed by him or at the place where he resides, or to compensate
him for the increased cost of living, as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette
specify, shall not form part of the total income of the assessee to such notified extent.
(c) The types of and the extent to which the allowances were exempt were hitherto notified by the Central
Government in terms of the power delegated to it under Section 10(14) of the Act. The Finance Act, 1995, has
with effect from 1st July, 1995, delegated this power to the Central Board of Direct Taxes with a view to enabling
it to make necessary rules in this regard so that all the exemptions can be found at one place under the relevant
rule instead of one having to look at all the notifications issued by the Central Government from time to time.
Accordingly, the CBDT has inserted a new rule 2BB to the Income-tax Rules, 1962, w.e.f. 1st July, 1995 which
is reproduced below for easy reference:
Rule 2BB. Prescribed allowances for the purposes of clause (14)(i) of Section 10 - For the purposes of sub-clause
(i) of clause (14) of Section 10, prescribed allowances, by whatever name called, shall be the following, namely –
(a) any allowance granted to meet the cost of travel on tour or on transfer;
(b) any allowance, whether granted on tour or for the period of journey in connection with transfer, to meet the
ordinary daily charges incurred by an employee on account of absence from his normal place of duty;
(c) any allowance granted to meet the expenditure incurred on conveyance in performance of duties of an
office or employment of profit;
Provided that free conveyance is not provided by the employer;
(d) any allowance granted to meet the expenditure incurred on a helper where such helper is engaged for
the performance of the duties of an office or employment of profit;
(e) any allowance granted for encouraging the academic, research and training pursuits in educational and
research institutions;
(f) any allowance granted to meet the expenditure incurred on the purchase or maintenance of uniform for
wear during the performance of the duties of an office or employment of profit.
Explanation - For the purpose of clause (a), “allowance granted to meet the cost of travel on transfer” includes
any sum paid in connection with transfer, packing and transportation of personal effects on such transfer.
(2) For the purposes of sub-clause (ii) of clause (14) of Section 10, the prescribed allowances, by whatever
name called, and the extent thereof shall be following, namely Sl.

TAX EXEMPTIONS FOR CHARITABLE TRUSTS AND INSTITUTIONS
Before the discussion of the provisions of the Income-tax Act in this connection, it is important to note the
meanings of the terms - Trust, Institution, Income from property, Charitable purpose and Religious purpose.
(a) Trust: Section 3 of the Indian Trusts Act defines a trust to mean “an obligation annexed to the ownership
of property and arising out of a confidence reposed in and accepted by the owner, or declared and
accepted by him for the benefit of another and the owner”.
(b) Institution: An organisation with a constitution composed of a President, Vice-President, Secretary,
Committee Members and ordinary members, is known as an Institution. The activities of the institution
and its office-holders are regulated by rules and bye-laws of the institution. A university or a Chamber of
Commerce is an Institution.
(c) Income from property: This includes income from movable or immovable property, voluntary donations
received and income from business undertaking(s) held by the trust.
(d) Charitable purpose: The term ‘charitable purpose’ has been defined in this Act in a wider sense than
what is commonly understood. According to Section 2(15) of the Act, it includes relief of the poor,
education, yoga medical relief, preservation of environment (including watersheds, forests and wildlife)
and preservation of monuments or places or objects of artistic or historic interest and advancement of
any other object of general public utility not involving the carrying on of any activity for profit.
In order to qualify for tax exemptions the charity must be of a public character, and the trust or institution
should not be created or established for the benefit of any particular religious community or caste, if the
trust or institution is established for the benefit of the member of a club or employees of a factory, it
would not be a public charitable trust. Vide Circular No. 395 dated Sept. 24, 1984 promotion of sports
and games is considered to be a charitable purpose within the meaning of Section 2(15). Accordingly
an association or institution, engaged in the promotion of sports or games can claim exemption under
Section 11, even if it is not approved under Section 10(23).
Provided that the advancement of any other object of general public utility shall not be a charitable purpose, if it
involves the carrying on of any activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business, or any activity of rendering
any service in relation to any trade, commerce or business, for a cess or fee or any other consideration, irrespective
of the nature of use or application, or retention, of the income from such activity, unless –
(i) such activity is undertaken in the course of actual carrying out of such advancement of any other object
of general public utility; and
(ii) the aggregate receipts from such activity or activities during the previous year, do not exceed twenty per
cent of the total receipts, of the trust or institution undertaking such activity or activities, of that previous
year;

98 EP-TL&P

Income not to be included in the Total Income
According to Section 11(1), the following items of income are not to be included in the total income of the
previous year of the assessee who is in receipt of the same:
(i) Income derived from property held under trust wholly for charitable or religious purposes: Income
derived from property held under trust wholly for charitable or religious purposes shall be exempt to the
extent to which such income is applied for such purposes in India and where any such income is
accumulated or set apart for application to such purposes in India, to the extent to which the income so
accumulated or set apart is not in excess of 15% of the income from such property.
(ii) Income derived from property held under trust in part only for charitable or religious purposes:
Income derived from property held under trust in part only for charitable or religious purposes shall be
exempt. This exemption would, however, be available only for trusts created before 1.4.1962. Further,
where any such income is finally set apart for application to such purposes in India, shall be exempt to
the extent to which the income so set apart is not in excess of 15% of the income from such property.
(iii) Income from property held under trust created on or after 1.4.1952 for a charitable purpose which
tends to promote international welfare in which India is interested shall be exempt to the extent to which
such income is applied for such charitable purposes outside India.
(iv) Income from property held under trust created before 1.4.1952 for charitable or religious purposes
shall be exempt to the extent to which such income is applied for such purposes outside India. This
exemption is, however, subject to the condition that the Central Board of Direct Taxes has, by a general
or special order, issued a direction in either of the above two cases that the income in question would
not be included in the total income of the person in receipt of such income.
(v) Income in the form of voluntary contributions made with a specific direction that they shall form part
of the corpus of the trust or institution shall be fully exempt.
Explanation:
In respect of items (i) and (ii) above:
(1) In computing the 15% of the income which may be accumulated or set apart, any such voluntary
contributions as are referred to in Section 12 (dealt with later in this Chapter) shall be deemed to be part
of the income.
(2) If, in the previous year, the income applied to charitable or religious purposes in India falls short of 85%
of the income derived during that year from property held under trust, by any amount on account of (i)
not receiving the income during that year, or (ii) for any other reason, then:
(a) In case referred to in (i), so much of the income applied to such purpose in India during the previous
year in which the income is received or during the previous year immediately following as does not
exceed the said amount shall be deemed to be income applied to such purposes during the previous
year in which the income was derived; and the income so deemed to have been applied shall not be
taken into account in calculating the amount of income applied to such purposes during the previous
year in which the income is received or during the previous year immediately following, as the case
may be.
(b) In case referred to in (ii), so much of the income applied to such purposes in India during the
previous year immediately following the previous year in which the income was derived as does not
exceed the said amount shall be deemed to be income applied to such purposes during the previous
year in which the income was derived; and the income so deemed to have been applied shall not be
taken into account in calculating the amount of income applied to such purposes during the previous
year immediately following the previous year in which the income was derived.

Where any income as discussed in (a) and (b) above is not applied to charitable or religious purposes in India
within the prescribed time, then such income shall be deemed to be the income of the person in receipt thereof:
(a) In case of not receiving the income: Such income shall be deemed to be the income of the previous year
immediately following the previous year in which the income was received.
(b) In any other case: Such income shall be deemed to be the income of the previous year immediately

Capital Gains [Section 11(1A)]
Asset held wholly for religious purposes or charitable purposes
Sometimes a capital asset held under trust wholly for charitable or religious purposes is transferred resulting in
a capital gain. The net consideration received on such transfer may be utilised wholly or in part in acquiring
another capital asset to be so held wholly for religious or charitable purposes. In such cases the capital gains
arising from the transfer shall be deemed to have been applied for charitable or religious purposes to the extent
stated hereinbelow:
(i) Where the whole of the net consideration is utilised for acquiring the new capital assets, so much of the
capital gains.
(ii) Where only a part of the net consideration is utilised for acquiring the new capital asset, so much of the
capital gain as is equal to the amount by which the amount so utilised exceeds the cost of the transferred
asset.
Example 1: A charitable trust had a capital asset the cost of which was `80,000 and it sold the same for `
1,00,000. The whole of the consideration, i.e., `1,00,000 will be exempt from capital gains tax if a new capital
asset is bought for `1,00,000.
Example 2: If a trust had a capital asset costing ` 1,00,000 and sold the same for ` 1,50,000 and then bought a
capital asset for ` 1,30,000, then the working will be as follows:
`
Sale proceeds of old asset

1,50,000

Cost of the old asset

(1,00,000)

Capital gain

50,000

Cost of the new asset

1,30,000

Cost of the old asset

(1,00,000)

Capital gain utilised is

30,000

Capital gain taxable is

20,000

Assets held partly for religious or charitable purposes
It is quite possible that a capital asset is held by a trust partly for religious or charitable purposes. Where such a
capital asset is transferred and the whole or any part of the net consideration is utilised for acquiring another
capital asset, the appropriate fraction of the capital gain arising from the transfer shall be deemed to have been
applied to charitable or religious purposes to the extent specified here under:
(i) where the whole of the net consideration is utilised in acquiring the new capital asset, the whole of the
appropriate fraction of such capital gain;
(ii) in any other case, so much of the appropriate fraction of the capital gain as is equal to the amount, if any,
by which the appropriate fraction of the amount utilised for acquiring the new asset exceeds the
appropriate fraction of the cost of the transferred asset.

100 EP-TL&P
“Explanation” to Section 11(1A) provides:
‘Appropriate fraction’ means the fraction which represents the extent to which the income derived from the
capital asset transferred was immediately before such transfer applicable to charitable or religious purposes.
‘Cost of the transferred asset’ means the aggregate of the cost of acquisition (as ascertained for the purposes of
Section 48 and 49 of the capital asset which is the subject of the transfer and the cost of any improvement
thereto within the meaning assigned to that expression in sub-clause (b) of clause (1) of Section 55.
‘Net consideration’ means the full value of the consideration received or accruing as a result of the transfer of the
capital asset as reduced by any expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with such transfer.
Illustration
A trust has a capital asset costing ` 2,00,000 and 1/2 of its income is utilised for charitable purpose. It is sold for
` 3,50,000. If the trust buys another capital asset for ` 3,50,000 then appropriate fraction of the capital gain
deemed to have been applied for charitable purpose. Supposing that the trust buys another asset for ` 2,90,000:
`

Accumulations of Income [Section 11(2)]
While dealing with Section 11 it has been stated that accumulation of income from trust property held for charitable
purpose is permissible up to 15 per cent without attracting any liability to tax. Where the balance 85 per cent of
the income is not applied or is not deemed to have been applied to charitable or religious purposes in India

Procedure for Registration (Section 12AA)
In terms of Section 12AA, on receipt of application for registration, the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner
shall call for such documents or information from the trust or institution as he thinks necessary in order to satisfy
himself about the genuineness of activities of the trust or institution and may also make such inquiries as he may

months from the end of the month in which the application was received.
Where the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner is satified that the activites of the trust or institution are not

may pass an order in writing for the cancellation of registration granted under section 12AA or under section 12A
after giving an opportunity of being heard.
Further, where a trust or an institution has been granted registration or has obtained registration at any time
under section 12A and subsequently it is noticed that the activities of the trust or the institution are being carried

Levy of tax where the charitable institution ceases to exist or converts into a non-charitable
organization
Sections 11 and 12 of the Act provide for exemption to trusts or institutions in respect of income derived from
property held under trust and voluntary contributions, subject to various conditions contained in the said sections.
The primary condition for grant of exemption is that the income derived from property held under trust should be
applied for the charitable purposes, and where such income cannot be applied during the previous year, it has
to be accumulated and invested in the modes prescribed and applied for such purposes in accordance with
various conditions provided in the section. If the accumulated income is not applied in accordance with the
conditions provided in the said section within a specified time, then such income is deemed to be taxable
income of the trust or the institution. Section 12AA provides for registration of the trust or institution which
entitles them to be able to get the benefit of sections 11 and 12. It also provides the circumstances under which
the registration can be cancelled. Section 13 of the Act provides for the circumstances under which exemption
under section 11 or 12 in respect of whole or part of income would not be available to a trust or institution.
A society or a company or a trust or an institution carrying on charitable activity may voluntarily wind up its
activities and dissolve or may also merge with any other charitable or non-charitable institution, or it may convert
into a non-charitable organization. In such a situation, the existing law does not provide any clarity as to how the
assets of such a charitable institution shall be dealt with.
In order to ensure that the intended purpose of exemption availed by trust or institution is achieved, a new
chapter has been introduced that provide for levy of additional income-tax in case of conversion into, or merger
with, any non-charitable form or on transfer of assets of a charitable organization on its dissolution to a noncharitable institution. The elements of the regime are under:
i. The accretion in income (accreted income) of the trust or institution shall be taxable on conversion of
trust or institution into a form not eligible for registration u/s 12AA or on merger into an entity not having
similar objects and registered under section 12AA or on non-distribution of assets on dissolution to any
charitable institution registered u/s 12AA or approved under section 10(23C) within a period twelve
months from dissolution.
ii. Accreted income shall be amount of aggregate of total assets as reduced by the liability as on the
specified date. The method of valuation is proposed to be prescribed in rules. The asset and the liability

106 EP-TL&P
of the charitable organisation which have been transferred to another charitable organisation within
specified time will be excluded while calculating accreted income.
iii. The taxation of accreted income shall be at the maximum marginal rate.
iv. This levy shall be in addition to any income chargeable to tax in the hands of the entity.
v. This tax shall be final tax for which no credit can be taken by the trust or institution or any other person,
and like any other additional tax, it shall be leviable even if the trust or institution does not have any other
income chargeable to tax in the relevant previous year.
vi. In case of failure of payment of tax within the prescribed time, a simple interest @ 1% per month or part
of it shall be applicable for the period of non-payment.
vii. For the purpose of recovery of tax and interest, the principal officer or the trustee and the trust or the
institution shall be deemed to be assessee in default and all provisions related to the recovery of taxes
shall apply. Further, the recipient of assets of the trust, which is not a charitable organisation, shall also
be liable to be held as assessee in default in case of non-payment of tax and interest. However, the
recipient’s liability shall be limited to the extent of the assets received.
These amendments effective from 1st June, 2016.

Exemption in respect of certain activity related to diamond trading in “Special Notified Zone”
The existing provisions of section 5 of the Act provides for the scope of total income. In the case of a nonresident, the taxation of income takes place only if the income accrues or arises in India or is deemed to accrue
or arise in India or is received in India. Section 9 of the Act provides for circumstances in which the income is
deemed to accrue or arise in India. One of the circumstances providing for income to be deemed to accrue or
arise in India is if any income is directly or indirectly derived through or from a business connection in India.
In order to facilitate the FMCs to undertake activity of display of uncut diamond (without any sorting or sale) in
the special notified zone, the provision of Section 9 of the Act has been amended to provide that in case of a
foreign company engaged in the business of mining of diamonds, no income shall be deemed to accrue or arise
in India to it through or from the activities which are confined to display of uncut and unassorted diamonds in a
Special Zone notified by the Central Government in the Official Gazette in this behalf.

31st March, 2019 subject to certain conditions as under:a) The project is completed within a period of three years from the date of approval,

Tax Incentives to International Financial Services Centre
Under the existing provisions of clause (38) of section 10, income by way of long term capital gains arising from
equity shares or units of an equity oriented fund or business trust is exempt where securities transaction tax is

services hub, Section 10 of the Act has been amended so as to provide for exemption from tax on capital gains
to the income arising from transaction undertaken in foreign currency on a recognised stock exchange located
in an International Financial Services Centre even when securities transaction tax is not paid in respect of such
transactions.

Income to be included in Total Income [Section 13(1)]
The exemption granted by Sections 11 or 12 of the Act would not, however, be available in the following cases
and circumstances:
(a) Where any part of the income from property held under trust for private religious purposes does not
enure for the benefit of the public;
(b) In the case of a trust for charitable purposes or an institution created or established for charitable
purposes on or after 1.4.1962, any income of the trust will not qualify for tax exemption if the trust or
institution is created or established for benefit of any particular religious community or caste. By virtue of
explanation 2 to Section 13, any trust created for the benefit of Scheduled Castes, backward classes, or
Scheduled Tribes or women or children would not be deemed to be a trust or institution created or
established for the benefit of any particular religious community or caste for purposes of this exemption.
Consequently, income derived by trusts or institutions established purely for the benefit of scheduled
castes or tribes or backward classes or women or children would qualify for tax exemption even though
the income is applied in reality for the benefit of a particular community or caste.
(c) In the case of a trust or institution established after 1.4.1962 or in the case of a trust, whenever created
or established, if the income of the trust or institution is applied during the accounting year, directly or
indirectly for benefit of any of the specified persons or if under the terms of the trust or the rules governing
that institution, any part of the income of the trust enures for the benefit of such specified persons,
whether directly or indirectly, the trust would not be given tax exemption under Section 11, with the
exception that (i) where such use or application is by way of compliance with a mandatory term of the
trust or a mandatory rule governing the institution, and (ii) where such use or application relates to any
period before the 1st day of June, 1970, the aforementioned provision shall not apply.
(d) Where any business is owned by a religious or charitable trust or institution, the income of such business
shall be determined by the Assessing Officer in the same way as the assessment of business income of
any other assessee. Consequently, any additions to the business income shown in the accounts of the
assessee made by the Assessing Officer is deemed to be income applied by the trust for purposes
other than charitable or religious. Such additions, therefore, do not qualify for tax exemptions under
Section 11(4).
However, in the case of a trust or institution established before 1.4.1962, the exemption would not be forfeited
merely on the ground that a part of the income or property of the trust or institution is applied directly or indirectly
for the benefit of the specified persons if such use or application is for compliance with a mandatory term of the
trust or a mandatory rule governing the institution.
For purposes of the disallowance of exemption, the ‘specified persons’ are the following namely:
(i) the author of the trust or the founder of the institution,
(ii) any person who has made a substantial contribution to the trust or institution, that is to say, any person
whose total contribution up to the end of the relevant previous year exceeds ` 25,000,
(iii) where the author, founder or other substantial contributor is a Hindu Undivided Family, any member of
the family,
(iv) any trustee of the trust or manager, by whatever name called, of the institution,
(v) any relative of such author, founder, person, member, trustee or manager, referred to above, and
(vi) any concern in which any of the above mentioned persons has a substantial interest.
The expression ‘relative’ used for this purpose has been defined in the Explanation (1) to Section 13 to mean:

Lesson 3

Incomes which do not Form Part of Total Income

109

(i) the spouse of the individual,
(ii) brother or sister of the individual,
(iii) the brother or sister of the spouse of the individual,
(iv) any lineal ascendant or descendant of the individual,
(v) any lineal ascendant or descendant of the spouse of the individual, and
(vi) the spouse of any of the persons referred to in (ii) to (v) above and any lineal ascendant or descendant
of a brother or sister of either the individual or the spouse of the individual.
The income or the property of the trust or institution or any part thereof shall be deemed to have been used or
applied for the benefit of the specified persons and consequently the trust will forfeit its exemption from incometax in the following cases specified in Section 13(2):
(i) Where any part of the income or property of the trust or institution is, or continues to be lent to any of the
specified persons for any period during the previous year without either adequate security or adequate
interest or both;
(ii) If any land, building or other property of the trust or institution is or continues to be made available for the
use of any of the specified persons for any period during the previous year without charging adequate
rent or other compensation;
(iii) If any amount is paid by way of salary, allowance or otherwise during the previous year to any of the
specified persons out of the resources of the trust or institution for service rendered by that person to
such trust or institution and the amount so paid is in excess of what may reasonably be paid for such
service;
(iv) If the services of the trust or institution are made available to any of the specified persons during the
previous year without adequate remuneration or other compensation;
(v) If any security, share or other property is purchased by or on behalf of the trust or institution from any of
the specified persons during the previous year for a consideration which is more than adequate;
(vi) If any share, security or other property is sold by or on behalf of the trust or institution to any of the
specified persons during the accounting year for a consideration which is less than adequate;
(vii) If any income or property of the trust or institution is diverted during the previous year in favour of any of
the specified persons. However, if the total value of the income and/or property so diverted does not
exceed ` 1,000 in value, the trust will not forfeit the exemption merely because any portion of the
income or property of the trust is diverted for the benefit of any of the specified persons; and
(viii) If any funds of the trust or the institution are, or continue to remain, invested for any period during the
accounting year in any concern in which any of the specified persons has a substantial interest.
For purposes of disallowance of the exemption to a charitable trust or institution the specified persons shall be
deemed to have a substantial interest in a concern under the following circumstances:
(i) In case where the concern is a company - if its equity shares carrying not less than 20% of the total
voting power are, at any time during the previous year, owned beneficially by such person or partly by
such person and partly by one or more of the other specified persons, or
(ii) In the case of any other concern - if such specified persons are entitled individually or jointly to not less
than 20% of the profits of such concern at any time during the relevant accounting year.
Where the trust funds are invested in a concern in which any of the specified persons has a substantial interest

110 EP-TL&P
and the quantum of the investment does not exceed 5% of the capital of the concern, the exemption shall not be
allowed in respect of the income arising from such investment and the remaining income will continue to enjoy
exemption from tax.
Further for debentures of an Indian company/Corporation acquired by the trust/institution after 28 February,
1983 but before 25th July, 1991, the exemption from tax under Section 11 or Section 12 shall be allowed to the
trust/institution in respect of interest on such debentures if the trust/institution disinvests such debentures latest
by 31st March, 1992
Any charitable or religious trust or institution will forfeit exemption from tax if any funds of the trust or institution
are invested or deposited, after February 28, 1983, otherwise than in any one or more of the modes specified in
Section 11(5). Such trusts and institutions will also forfeit exemption from tax if any part of their funds invested
before March 1, 1983 otherwise than in any one or more of the forms or modes specified in Section 11(5)
continue to remain so invested or deposited after November 30, 1983. Trusts or institutions which continue to
hold any shares in a company (other than a Government company or a statutory corporation) after the said date
will also forfeit exemption from income-tax.
The aforesaid provisions will, however, not apply in relation to assets which constituted the original corpus of the
trust or institution as on June 1, 1973 and any accretion to the assets being shares of a company forming part of
the corpus of the trust or institution as on June 1, 1973, where such accretion arises by way of bonus shares.
The aforesaid provisions will also not apply in relation to assets (being debentures issued by a company)
acquired by the trust/institution before March 1, 1983. Further, it will not apply in relation to any asset [other than
an investment or deposit in the mode or form as specified in Section 11(5)] which is held after the expiry of one
year from the end of the previous year in which such asset is acquired or the 31st Day of March, 1993 whichever
is later in the mode and form as specified in Section 11(5). Also, it will not apply in relation to any funds representing
the profits and gains of business relevant to the assessment year 1984-85 or any subsequent year.
Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (1) or Sub-section (2), but without prejudice to the provisions
contained in Sub-section (2) of Section 12, in the case of a charitable or religious trust running an educational
institution or a medical institution or a hospital, the exemption under Section 11 or Section 12 shall not be denied
in relation to any income, other than the income referred to in Sub-section (2) of Section 12, by reason only that
such trust has provided educational or medical facilities to persons referred to in Clause (a) or Clause (b) or
Clause (c) or Clause (cc) or Clause (d) of Sub-section (3).
If the trust or institution has any other income in addition to profits and gains of business, for getting exemption
under this clause separate books of account in respect of such business are to be maintained.
Business income of charitable trusts: The exemption from income- tax will not be denied to any religious or
charitable trust in respect of profits or gains of business, provided that:
(a) the business is carried on by a trust wholly for public religious purposes and the business consists of
printing and publication of books or is of a kind notified by the Government, or
(b) the business is carried on by an institution wholly for charitable purposes and the work in connection
with the business is mainly carried on by the beneficiaries of the institution and, separate books of
account are maintained by the trust/institution of such business.
As per Section 13(7), nothing contained in Section 11 or 12 shall operate so as to exclude from the total income
of the previous year of the person in receipt thereof, any anonymous donation referred to in Section 115BBC on
which tax is payable in accordance with the provisions of that section.
As per sub-section (8) to section 13 nothing contained in section 11 or section 12 shall operate so as to exclude
any income from the total income of the previous year of the person in receipt thereof if the provisions of the first
proviso to clause (15) of section 2 become applicable in the case of such person in the said previous year.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

– Basis of Charge

The taxability of income of a person depends
on the chargeability of such income under the
Income tax Act 1961. The total income of an
assessee (subject to statutory exemptions) is
chargeable under Section 4(1). The scope of
the total income, which varies with the
residential status, is defined in Section 5.
Section 14 enumerates the heads of income
under which the income of an assessee will fall.
The rules for computing income and the
permissible deductions under different heads
of income, are dealt in different sections of the
Act. The heads of income, along with their
corresponding set of sections for the purpose
of computation of income, are given below :

– Salary [Section 17(1)]
– Allowances
– Perquisites [Section 17(2)]
(A) Tax-free perquisites (in all cases)
(B) Taxable perquisites (in all cases)
(C) Perquisites taxable only in the
cases of Specified Employees
– Valuation of Perquisites
– Profits in Lieu of or in Addition to Salary
– Deductions Allowed from Salaries
(Section 16)

(A) Salaries (Sections 15 to 17);

– Provident funds - Treatment of
Contributions to and Money Received
from the Provident Fund

(B) Income from house property (Sections 22
to 27);
(C) Profits and gains of business or
profession (Sections 28 to 44D);

– Incomes exempt from Tax and not
includible in ‘Salary’

(D) Capital gains (Sections 45 to 55A); and

– Tax Deducted at Source

(E) Income from other sources (Sections 56
to 59).

– Illustrations
– LESSON ROUND UP

At the end of this lesson, you will learn how to
calculate income under the head salaries, what
are the deductions, exemptions available from
salaries.

– SELF TEST QUESTION

All income received as salary under Employer – Employee relationship is taxed under this head.
On due or receipt basis, whichever arises earlier. Employers must withhold tax compulsarily (subject
to section 192), if income exceeds minimum exemption limit, as tax deducted at source (TDS), and
provide their employees Form 16 which shows the total amount of tax deducted from his net income.
117

118 EP-TL&P

BASIS OF CHARGE
As per Section 15, the income chargeable to income tax under the head salaries would include :
Any salary due to an employee from an employer or a former employer to an assessee during the previous year
irrespective of the fact whether it is paid or not.
Any salary paid or allowed to the employee during the previous year by or on behalf of an employer, or former
employer, would be taxable under this head even though such amounts are not due to him during the accounting
year
Arrears of salary paid or allowed to the employee during the previous year by or on behalf of an employer or a
former employer would be chargeable to tax during the previous year in cases where such arrears were not
charged to tax in any earlier year.
However it would not include:
– Any salary paid in advance and included in the total income of any person for any previous year, shall
not be included again in the total income of the person when the salary becomes due.
– Any salary, bonus, commission or remuneration, by whatever name called, due to, or received by, a
partner of a firm from the firm shall not be regarded as “salary” for the purposes of this section.

Due Basis of Taxation
The basis of taxation of income from salary is normally on ‘due’ basis. Thus, salary due to an employee is
taxable regardless of the fact whether he actually receives it or not. Exceptions to this rule is case where
salary is received in advance by an employee which is chargeable to tax as and when it is received although
the salary is not due to him. But in order to ensure that there is no double taxation of the same item of
income in the hands of the same employee, the explanation to Section 15 specifically provides that where
an item of a salary income received by an employee in advance is taxed as and when it is received, it shall
not again be charged to tax when it becomes due to the assessee. In order to attract liability to tax under
this head, it is not essential that the employee, who is liable to tax under this head, must receive salary from
his present employer.
Illustration: Yana is an employee of Tara Pvt. Ltd. getting a salary of ` 40,000 per month which becomes due on
the last day of the month but is paid on the 7th of next month. Salary for which months will be taxable for AY 201718?
Solution: The salary for the months of April 2016 to March 2017 will be taxable for the the Assessment Year
2017-18 because salary for April 2016 will be due on 30th April, 2016 (i.e. within the same month).
Illustration: Mr. X is an employee of Y Ltd. His salary is ` 25,000 per month. Salary becomes due on last day of
each month. In March, 2017, he received salary of April and May in Advance. Compute taxable amount for AY
2017-18 and AY 2018-19.
Solution: Taxable Salary for AY 2017-18 (PY 2016-17):
– Salary for the months of April, 2016 to March, 2017 will be taxable on due basis.
– Salary for the month of April, 2017 and May, 2017 will also be taxable on receipt basis. Therefore, it will
not be taxable in AY 2018-19 on receipt basis.
– Thus, taxable salary for AY 2017-18= ` 25,000*12 + ` 25,000*2 = ` 3,50,000
Taxable Salary for AY 2018-19 (PY 2017-18):

Lesson 4

Part I – Income under the Head Salaries

119

– Salary for the month of June, 2017 to March, 2018 will only be taxable on due basis. Salary for April and
May 2017 will not be taxable as that has already been taxed on receipt basis in the AY 2017-18.
Thus, taxable salary for AY 2018-19 = ` 25,000*10 = ` 2,50,000

Computation of Salary in the Grade System
An employee may be entitled to receive salary in grade system. Under this system, the normal annual increments
to be given to the employee are already fixed in the grade. For example, if an employee joins the service on
1.6.2010 and is placed in the grade of ` 10,000-1,000-15,000-2,000-25,000 then his salary from 1.6.2010 will be
` 10,000 p.m. and thereafter his salary will be ` 11,000 p.m. w.e.f. 31.5.2011 until it reaches ` 15,000 after which
it will increase annually by ` 2,000 until it reaches ` 25,000. After that, employee will be placed in another grade.
In certain cases, employee joins in the grade at a salary in between the grade, in that case his salary will
annually increase in the aforesaid manner the only difference would be that his initial salary would be a different
amount than the start of the grade.
Illustration: A joins the service in the grade of 10,000-1000-15,000-2,000-25,000 on 01.08.2012 at a salary of
` 13,000. Compute taxable salary for AY 2017-18.
Solution: Computation of Taxable Salary for Previous Year 2016-17 (1-4-2016 to 31-3-2017):
Salary from 1.8.2012 to 31.7.2013 : ` 13,000 p.m.
Salary from 1.8.2013 to 31.7.2014 : ` 14,000 p.m.
Salary from 1.8.2014 to 31.7.2015 : `. 15,000 p.m.
Salary from 1.8.2015 to 31.7.2016 : ` 17,000 p.m.
Salary from 1.8.2016 to 31.7.2017 : ` 19,000 p.m.
Salary for Previous year 2016-17 will be divided into two parts:
Salary from 1.4.2016 to 31.7.2016 = 17,000 * 4 = ` 68,000
Salary from 1.8.2016 to 31.3.2017 = 19,000 * 8 = ` 1,52,000
Total Salary for P.Y. 2016-17 = ` 2,20,000

Employer and Employee Relationship
The salary of an employee is a separate source, distinct from other classes of income. The basis of liability
under the head salaries is the employer-employee relationship. Before charging the particular income received
by a person under this head, care must be taken to ensure that there exists such a relationship of employer
and employee between the recipient and the payer of the income. The payments chargeable under the head
salaries must be made between the persons who are in the relationship of employer and employee. Therefore,
the amount received by an individual shall be treated as salary only if the relationship between payer and
payee is of an employer and employee or master and servant. Employer may be an individual, firm, and
association of persons, company, corporation, Central Government, State Government, public body or a local
authority. Likewise, employer may be operating in India or abroad. The employee may be full time employee
or part-time employee.
The question whether a particular person receives the income in his capacity as an employee or not has to be
decided from the facts of each case.
Let’s examine the following cases, whether payments are chargeable under head salaries;

120 EP-TL&P
(i) The professor of university would be receiving income by way of monthly salary from the university
which is chargeable to tax under this head. But this does not mean that every item of income received
by the employee from his employer would be taxable under this head. Thus, income by way of
examinership fees received by a professor from the same university in which he is employed would not
be chargeable to tax under this head but must be taxed as Income from other sources under Section 56.
This is because of the fact that the essential condition that the income in question must be received for
services rendered in the ordinary course of employment would not be fulfilled in the case of examinership
fees.
(ii) A director of a company may, in some cases, be an employee of a company where there is a specific
contract of employment between him and the company. The fact that the same person has dual
capacity in his relationship with the company does not mean that he cannot be taxed under this head.
Every item of income arising to such a director who is also an employee of the company (e.g. a
managing director or other whole-time director) by virtue of his employment would be taxable as his
income from salary. Thus, income by way of remuneration received by a managing director would be
taxable as his salary income whereas the income received by him as director’s fees in his capacity as
director for attending the meetings of the Board would be assessable under the head “Income from
other sources”.
(iii) An official liquidator appointed by the Court or by the Central Government would also become an employee
of the Central Government under Section 448 of the Companies Act, 1956 and consequently the
remuneration due to him would also be assessable under the head ‘Salaries’.
(iv) Remuneration received by a manager of a company even if he is wrongly designated as a director or by
any other name would be chargeable to tax under this head regardless of the fact that the amount is
payable to him monthly or is calculated at a certain percentage of the company’s profits.
(v) Salary paid to a partner by a firm is nothing but appropriation of profits. Any salary, bonus, commission,
or remuneration by whatever name called due to or received by partner of a firm shall not be regarded
as salary but has to be charged as income from business. It is because of the fact that the relationship
between the firm and its partner is not of employer and employee.
(vi) According to a circular of the Board dated 22-5-1967, the salary received by a person as Member of
Parliament will not be chargeable to income-tax under the head “Salaries” but as “Income from other
sources” because a Member of Parliament is not an employee of the Government but only an elected
representative of the people.
(vii) The income received by a treasurer of a bank would be taxable as his salary income if the treasurer is
an employee of the bank. If he does not happen to be an employee, the income received by him would
be taxable as “Income from other sources”. For this purpose, the question whether in a particular case
the treasurer is an employee or not has to be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances of
each case having due regard to his powers, responsibilities and functions.
(viii) Income derived by any person from carrying on a profession or vocation must be taxed as business
income and not as salary income because employment is different from profession.
But, if an employee receives any money from his employer as part of the terms of employment for not
carrying on any profession, such income must be taxed as salary income. For instance, the allowance
given by employer to a doctor employed by him for not carrying on a profession in addition to the
employment would be income arising from employment in accordance with the terms and conditions of
such employment and must, therefore, be taxed as salary income. If an employee gets money from
persons other than his employer and if such money is not in any way related to the contract of services

Lesson 4

Part I – Income under the Head Salaries

121

with the employer under whom he is working, the receipts, if taxable as income, must be assessed
under the head “Income from other sources”.
However, gratuity, bonus, commission or other items of payment made by the employer without any
specific stipulation in the contract of employment to this effect, would still be taxable as salary, because
they are paid by the employer for the services rendered by the employee. The fact that such payments
are voluntary and in certain circumstances may qualify for exemption from income-tax in the hands of
the employee, would not affect the income being computed under the head salary.

SALARY RECEIVED FROM FORMER EMPLOYER
Even salaries received by an employee from former employer(s) for services rendered would be chargeable to
tax under this head. Hence, the fact that the employee in question is not an employee under the person from
whom the money is received at the time of its receipt, is irrelevant. Arrears of salaries are chargeable to tax as
the income of the year in which such arrears are received if they are not charged to tax at the time of becoming
due.

Other points for consideration for taxability of salary
(1) Any lump sum amount paid to an employee by his employer in commutation, reduction or substitution
of salary, pension or other type of income from employment, is nevertheless taxable as income from
salary in the year in which such payment falls due or is received by the employee, whichever is earlier.
Section 200 of the Companies Act totally prohibits any company from paying tax-free remuneration to
any of its employees.
(2) For purposes of computing the income taxable under this head, the gross salary due to the employee
should be taken as the basis. Thus, any tax deducted at source or other deductions on account of
provident fund, insurance premium, or on any other account made by the employer from the salary
income, should be added to the net salary received by the employee. The fact that some of the deductions
like provident fund or insurance premium may qualify for any deduction from gross total income in the
personal assessment of the employee, does not, in any way, affect the quantum of salary due to the
employee.
(3) Any salary voluntarily surrendered by the employee on or after 1- 4-1961 to the Central Government
under the provisions of the Voluntary Surrender of Salaries (Exemption from Taxation Act), 1961, would
not be treated as income taxable in the hands of the employee. In all other cases, the salary foregone
voluntarily or otherwise surrendered by the employee, would still be chargeable to tax although the
employee may not receive that income. No tax exemption is available for surrender of salaries for the
simple reason that the amount surrendered constitutes merely an application of income which is immaterial
for the purpose of taxing the employee.
If the foregoing or surrender of salary represents a donation for charitable purpose, the employee may
qualify for deduction from gross total income under Section 80G of the Act. However, salary foregone
before it becomes due cannot be taxed [C.I.T. v. Mehar Singh Sampuran Singh Chawla (1973) 90 ITR
219]. Further, where in reality there is no agreement to pay any salary, the apparent foregoing of a
fictional salary would not attract tax.
(4) Where a person, out of missionary spirit, agrees to work as principal in an institution without accepting
any salary from the institution, and in the school accounts his salary is shown as an item of expenditure,
while the same amount is entered in the receipts as a donation by the management in a separate cash
book meant for exclusive use for the management only, these entries are book entries only and no
money is actually paid to him; hence, taking into consideration the special circumstances of the case,
the fictional salary would not be taxable [Reade v. Brearley (1933) 17 TC 687].

122 EP-TL&P
(5) Salary is taxable even if the money is not received or could not be recovered from the employer due to
his insolvency or any other reason. The expenses, if any, incurred by the employee to take legal
proceedings against his employer for its recovery would not also be allowed as a deduction from the
income assessable in his hands. This is because of the fact that the actual receipt of the income is
immaterial for purpose of its taxation.
(6) It is immaterial whether the employer is Government or a private employer. Further, the salary may be
paid by a foreign Government to its employees serving in India, and this salary is taxable under the
head “Salaries”.
(7) The leave salary paid to the legal heirs of the deceased employee in respect of privilege leave standing
to the credit of such employee at the time of his/her death is not taxable as salary. It is an exgratia
payment on compassionate grounds in the nature of gift. Thus, the payment is not in the nature of a
salary (Letter from C.B.D.T. dated 5-11-1965 and circular No. 309 dated 3-7-1981).

SALARY [SECTION 17(1)]
“Salary” includes :
(i) Wages or Salary: ‘Salary’ is generally used in respect of payment for services of a higher class, whereas
‘wages’ is confined to the earnings of labourers. However, for income-tax purposes there is no difference
between salary and wages.
(ii) Annuity is annual grant made by the employer to the employee.
(iii) Pension is a periodical payment for past services.
(iv) Gratuity is a lump sum payment for past services.
(v) Fees and Commission: It is a remuneration to encourage employees.
(vi) Perquisites: These include all benefits and amenities provided by the employer to the employee, either
in cash or kind.
(vii) Profit in lieu of or in addition to salary or wages.
(viii) Advance of Salary.
(ix) Any payment received by an employee in respect of any period of leave not availed of by him.
(x) Taxable portion of annual accretion: Where the employee is a member of a Recognised Provident
Fund, the amount contributed by the employer in this fund in excess of 12 per cent of the salary of the
employee and interest credited on the amount of the fund in excess of the prescribed rate of interest is
to be included in the salary income.
(xi) Taxable portion of transferred balance: When an unrecognised provident fund is recognised for the first
time, the balance in the unrecognised provident fund is known as “Transferred balance”. The employer’s
share (contribution in unrecognised provident fund and interest on employer’s share) is included in the
salary income for income-tax purposes at the time of such transfer.
(xii) The contribution made by the Central Government in the previous year, the account of any employee
under a pension scheme referred to in Section 80CCD.

Important Notes :
(1) Advance salary is taxable on receipt basis in the previous year in which it is received. The recipient
can, however, claim relief under Section 89(1) read with Rule 21A.
(2) Arrears salary is taxable on receipt basis subject to the fact that it has not been taxed on accrual basis
earlier. The recipient can claim relief in terms of Section 89(1) read with Rule 21A.
(3) Encashment of leave salary (before retirement) is taxable on receipt basis but relief can be claimed
under Section 89(1). However, such salary received at the time of retirement is exempt subject to
Section 10(10AA).
(4) Pension received by a person from the employer after his retirement is taxed as salary. The pension
can be either uncommuted or commuted. Commuted pensions received by government employees
are wholly exempt under Section 10(10A). In case of non-Government employees, commuted value of
one-third of pension which he is normally entitled to receive is exempt from tax if the employee receives
gratuity. In other cases, one-half of commuted value of pension is exempt.
(5) Instalments re-paid under Additional Emoluments (C.D.) Act, 1974 are taxable as arrear of salary in the
previous year in which the same are received. However, relief under Section 89(1) can be claimed.

ALLOWANCES
An allowance is defined as a fixed amount of money given periodically in addition to the salary for the purpose
of meeting some specific requirements connected with the service rendered by the employee or by way of
compensation for some unusual conditions of employment. It is taxable on due/accrued basis whether it is paid
in addition to the salary or in lieu thereon. These allowances are generally taxable and are to be included in the
gross salary unless a specific exemption has been provided in respect of allowances provided under the following
sections:
(a) House Rent Allowances – Section 10(13A): Covered under Lesson 3.
(b) Special Allowance – Section 10(14)(i) & (ii): Covered under Lesson 4.

Fully Taxable Allowances
(1) Dearness Allowance, Additional Dearness Allowance and Dearness Pay: This is a very common allowance
these days on account of high prices. Sometimes Additional Dearness Allowance is also given. It is included in
the income from salary and is taxable in full. Sometimes it is given under the terms of employment and sometimes
without it. When it is given under the terms of employment it is included in salary for purposes of determining the
exemption limits of house rent allowance, recognised provident fund, gratuity and value of rent free house and
is also taken into account for the purposes of retirement benefits.
Sometimes dearness allowance is given as ‘Dearness Pay’. It means that it is being given under the terms of
employment.
(2) Fixed Medical Allowance: It is fully taxable.
(3) Tiffin Allowance: It is given for lunch and refreshments to the employees. It is taxable.
(4) Servant Allowance: It is fully taxable even if it is given to a low paid employee, not being an officer, i.e., it is
taxable for all categories of employees.

and they are banned from doing private practice. It is to compensate them for this ban. It is fully taxable.

124 EP-TL&P

for working as Warden of the hostel and/or working as Proctor in the institution. These allowances are fully
taxable.
(8) Deputation Allowance: When an employee is sent from his permanent place of service to some other
place or institution or organisation on deputation for a temporary period, he is given this allowance. It is fully
taxable.
(9) Overtime Allowance: When an employee works for extra hours over and above his normal hours of duty he
is given overtime allowance as extra wages. It is fully taxable.
(10) Other Allowances like Family allowance, Project allowance, Marriage allowance, City Compensatory

Allowances not fully taxable
(a) Special allowances for performance of official duty [section 10(14)(i)]: These allowances are specifically
granted to meet expenses wholly and exclusively incurred in the performance of official duty. These are exempt
to the extent such expenses are actually incurred or the amount received whichever is less. These allowances
are Travelling allowance, Daily allowance, Helper allowance, Academic Allowance, Uniform Allowance etc. All
these allowances are discussed in detail under Lesson 3.

Lesson 3.
– Allowances which are granted to meet personal expense are exempt to the fixed percentage of amount
received. These allowances are allowed to transport employees working in any transport system.

Treatment of Entertainment Allowance
In case of Entertainment allowance an assessee will not get any exemption but would be eligible for deduction
under section 16(ii) from gross salary. The deduction is allowed to government employees only; Non- Government
employees will not be eligible for this deduction. The entire amount of entertainment allowance will be added to
gross salary.
The minimum of the following shall be available as deduction in case of Government employees:
(i) Actual amount of entertainment allowance received during the year
(ii) 20% of his salary exclusive of any allowance, benefit or other perquisites.

Lesson 4

Part I – Income under the Head Salaries

(iii) Sum paid by the employer (directly or indirectly) for effecting an assurance on the life of the employee
or for providing an annuity. If the amount is paid to a recognised provident fund or an approved
superannuation fund, or to a deposit linked insurance fund established under the Coal Mines Provident
Fund Act or Employees’ Provident Fund Act, the sum so paid is not to be included in the salary
income.
(iv) Sum paid by the employer in respect of any obligation of the assessee, which would otherwise have
been payable by the assessee. Some of the examples of such expenses are as follows :
(a) Income-tax paid by the employer due from the employee.
(b) Payment of club bills, club subscription or hotel bills of the employee.
(c) Fees paid by the employer directly to the school or reimbursement of tuition fees of the children of
the employee.
(d) Payment of any loan due to the employee.
(v) The value of any specified security or sweat equity shares allotted or transferred, directly or indirectly,
by the employer, or former employer, free of cost or at concessional rate to the assessee.
(a) “specified security” means the securities as defined in clause (h) of section 2 of the Securities
Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 and, where employees’ stock option has been granted under any
plan or scheme therefor, includes the securities offered under such plan or scheme;
(b) “sweat equity shares” means equity shares issued by a company to its employees or directors at a
discount or for consideration other than cash for providing know-how or making available rights in
the nature of intellectual property rights or value additions, by whatever name called;
(c) the value of any specified security or sweat equity shares shall be the fair market value of the
specified security or sweat equity shares, as the case may be, on the date on which the option is
exercised by the assessee as reduced by the amount actually paid by, or recovered from the assessee

(e) “option” means a right but not an obligation granted to an employee to apply for the specified

(vi) The amount of any contribution to an approved superannuation fund by the employer in respect of the
assessee, to the extent it exceeds one lakh rupees;
(vii) The value of any other fringe benefit or amenity as may be prescribed.
Some other examples of taxable perquisites are as follows :
(a) Any reward awarded. For example, a professional jockey receives present from his employer on winning
the race.
(b) Any legal charges incurred by the employer to save or defend the employee. For instance, if an
employee knocks down a pedestrian during the course of employment or otherwise while driving the
company’s car due to his negligence and, to defend his case in the court, the employer incurs heavy
expenses, the amount spent by him on this account would represent a perquisite. It is likely that the
actual expenditure incurred by the employer might be much larger than what the employee himself
would have done if he were to take up the proceedings himself. Even in such cases, the perquisite
chargeable to tax would be the entire amount spent by the employer and not only a portion thereof
which the employee would have spent if he had himself taken up the legal proceedings in the court.
Thus, the cost of legal defence of a criminal charge or civil litigation expenses incurred by the employer

132 EP-TL&P
on behalf of the employee even in his own interest for the purpose of retaining the services of the
employee would be taxable as perquisite.

(C) Perquisites taxable only in the cases of Specified Employees
The value of certain benefit or amenity granted or provided free of cost or at a concessional rate in any of the
following cases only shall be included in the salary income:
(a) by a company to an employee who is director thereof [It is immaterial whether the director is full time or
part time director];
(b) by a company concern to an employee, being a person who has a substantial interest in the company
concern, i.e., employee is the beneficial owner of at least 20 per cent of the equity shares of that
company or is entitled to atleast 20 per cent share is profit of the concern;
(c) an employee whose income chargeable under head salaries (exclusive of the value of all benefits or
amenities not provided by way of monetry payments) excess ` 50,000, is a specified employed.
Some of the examples of such perquisite which are included in the salary income of a specified employee as
defined above are:
(i) Free boarding facility provided by employer.
(ii) Free conveyance for private use.
(iii) Free education facility to the family members of employee.
(iv) Holiday trips at employer’s cost.
(v) Gas, electricity or water supplied free for household consumption.
(vi) Wages of domestic servants paid by employer.
(vii) Free lunches or dinners.
Note: From 1.4.1990 the use of any vehicle provided by a company or an employer for journey by the assessee
from his residence to his office or other place of work, or from such office or place to his residence, shall not be
regarded as a benefit or amenity granted or provided to him free of cost or at concessional rate for the purpose
of computation of perquisite.

VALUATION OF PERQUISITES
The basic principles governing valuation of perquisites are as follows :
– The valuation is done on the basis of their value to the employee and not the employer’s cost for
providing the same - Wilkins v. Rogerson (1963) 49 ITR 395 (CA).
– The value of perquisite is included in the salary income only if the perquisite is actually provided to the
employee.
– Perquisite which is not actually enjoyed by the employee (though the terms of employment provide for
the same) cannot be valued and taxed in the employee’s hands. Therefore, where the employee waives
his right of perquisite, he cannot be taxed thereon.
The valuation of various perquisites is done as follows :

Provided that where the educational institution itself is maintained and owned by the employer and free educational
facilities are provided to the children of the employee or where such free educational facilities are provided in

calculated at the rate of 10% of such cost for each completed year during which such asset was put to use by the
employer and as further reduced by the amount, if any, paid or recovered from the employee being the
consideration for such transfer.
Provided that in the case of computers and electronic items, the normal wear and tear would be calculated at the
rate of 50% and in the case of motor cars at the rate of 20% by the reducing balance method (WDV).

PROFITS IN LIEU OF OR IN ADDITION TO SALARY
Under this the following items are included :

(i) The amount of any compensation due to or received by an assessee from the employer or former employer

at or in connection with the termination of his employment. The ‘termination of employment’ means retirement,
premature termination of employment, termination by death or voluntary resignation. Generally, under the Incometax Act, the income that is chargeable to tax is only a receipt which is revenue in nature; receipts of a capital
nature are not chargeable to tax but this provision constitutes an exception to this rule because compensation
received by an employee for termination of his employment would be a capital receipt since it is received in
replacement of the sources of income itself. Still it is chargeable to tax because of the specific provision in the
Act. However, relief under Section 89(1) would be available to the assessee in cases where he gets money
which represents a profit in lieu of salary.
The amount of any compensation due to or received by any assessee from his employer in connection with the
modification of the terms and conditions relating to employment. For example, where an employer wants to cut
down the salary payable to the employee, the lump sum paid to compensate the employee shall be treated as
profits in lieu of salary. In the same way, where the remuneration for services is paid at the end of the period of
employment or a lump sum remuneration is paid at the beginning of employment for a number of years, such
payment shall be treated as profits in lieu of salary.
(ii) Any amount due to or received, whether in lump sum or otherwise, by any assessee from any person - (A)
before his joining any employment with that person; or (B) after cessation of his employment with that person.
(iii) Any payment other than the following payment due to or received by assessee from an employer or a former
employer or from a provident or other fund, to the extent to which it does not consist of contribution by the
assessee or interest on such contributions by the assessee or interest on such contributions or any sum under
keyman Insurance Policy.

(1) Gratuity
Exceptions : The following shall not be included in the salary income :
(a) Death-cum-retirement gratuity received under :
(i) The Revised Pension Rules of the Central Government;
(ii) The Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972;

138 EP-TL&P
(iii) Any similar scheme applicable to the employees of Central, State or local authority;
(iv) The pension code or regulations applicable to the members of the defence services.
(b) Any gratuity received under the payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 to the extent it does not exceed
an amount calculated in accordance with the provisions of Sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 4 of that Act.
(c) Any other gratuity received by an employee on his retirement, or on his becoming incapacitated or on
termination of his employment or received by nominee on his death to the extent of half month’s salary
for each completed year of service calculated on the basis of the average salary for the ten months
immediately preceding the month in which any such event occurs, subject to such limit (`10,00,000 on
retirement, death or termination on or after 24.05.10 vide notification no. 43/2010 dated 11.06.2010.
Prior to this the limit was 3,50,000) as the Central Government may notify having regard to the limit
applicable in that behalf to the employees of that Government.
Note: For details see “Income which do not Form part of total income” in Lesson 3.

(2) Commuted value of pension
(a) In case of Government employees (Central, State, Local authority or statutory corporation), the full
amount of commuted value of pension is exempted.
(b) In case of non-Government employees, the exemption is as follows :
(i) where the employee receives any gratuity, the commuted value of one-third of the pension which he
is normally entitled to receive;
(ii) where the employee does not receive any gratuity, the commuted value of one-half of such pension.

(3) Retrenchment compensation
Retrenchment compensation received by a workman under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 or any other Act
or rules, orders or notifications issued thereunder or under any standing orders or under any award, contract
of service or otherwise to the extent of the actual award or ` 5,00,000 the amount notified by the Central
Government or the amount calculated u/s 25F(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 whichever is less.

(4) Amount received from Statutory Provident Fund and/or Public Provident Fund/Recognised
Provident Fund
The amount is exempt if the following conditions are satisfied :
(i) he has rendered a continuous service with his employer for five years or more; or
(ii) if he has not rendered such continuous service, the service has been terminated by reason of his ill
health, or discontinuance or contraction of employer’s business or any other cause beyond the control
of employee; or
(iii) on cessation of his employment, he obtains employment with any other employer and balance standing
in his Recognised Provident Fund is transferred to his account in the Recognised Provident Fund
maintained by the new employer.
Where the accumulated balance of recognised provident fund has been transferred to any other Recognised
Provident Fund [under clause (iii)] then in computing the period of continuous service for clause (i) or clause (ii),
the period or periods for which the employee rendered continuous service under his former employer or employers
shall be included.

(5) House rent allowance received from the employer
The exempted amount shall not exceed :

Lesson 4

Part I – Income under the Head Salaries

139

(a) actual amount of such allowance received in respect of the relevant period; or
(b) excess of rent paid or payable by the employee over ten per cent of salary (salary includes dearness
allowance, if the terms of employment so provide, (and also commission if based on percentage on
sales/turnover) but excludes all other allowances and perquisites) due in respect of the relevant period;
or
(c) an amount equal to –
(i) Where such accommodation is situated at Mumbai, Calcutta, Delhi or Chennai, 50% of the amount
of salary due to the assessee in respect of the relevant period; and
(ii) Where such accommodation is situated at any other place, 40% of the amount of salary due to the
assessee in respect of the relevant period;
(6) Remuneration for extra duties and voluntary payments to employees made by an employer, if such
payments are made in reference to services rendered by virtue of employment, also constitutes profits in lieu of
salary.
Note: For details, see “Incomes which do not form part of income” in Lesson 3.

DEDUCTIONS ALLOWED FROM SALARIES (SECTION 16)
The following amounts shall be deducted in order to arrive at the chargeable income under the head ‘Salaries’.
(A) Standard deduction: Omitted by Financial Act, 2005 w.e.f. 1.4.2006. – Section 16(i)
(B) Entertainment allowance : Where the employee is in receipt of entertainment allowance, the amount so
received shall first be included in the salary income and thereafter the following deduction shall be made Section 16(ii) :
16(ii). A deduction in respect of any allowance in the nature of an entertainment allowance specifically
granted by an employer to the assessee who is in receipt of a salary from the Government, a sum equal to onefifth of his salary (exclusive of any allowance, benefit or other perquisite) or five thousand rupees, whichever is
less.
W.e.f. April 1, 2002 entertainment allowance will be allowed in computing income from salary only in case of
employees of the Government and will cease to be allowable for persons other than those employed in Government
i.e. entertainment allowance deduction will not be allowed to other employees.
Note: For this purpose ‘Salary’ excludes any allowance, benefit or other perquisites:
Where an employee, not entitled to claim deduction under this clause, spends some money on the entertainment
of customers of the concern, the amount so spent cannot be deducted from the salary income. The condition
makes exemption well-nigh impossible for the employees of private sector. For them, the better course would be
to get the entertainment expenses reimbursed.
(C) Tax on employment or Professional Tax: From the assessment year 1990-91, deduction shall be allowed
in respect of any sum paid by the assessee on account of a tax on employment within the meaning of clause (2)
of article 276 of the Constitution, leviable by a State under any law passed by its legislature.
Where Professional/Employment tax is paid by the employer on behalf of the employee, it will first be included in
his gross salary as a perquisite, being a monetary obligation of the employee discharged by the employer.
Thereafter, a deduction on account of such professional tax shall be allowed to the employee from his gross
salary. Professional tax due but not paid shall not be allowed as deduction.

140 EP-TL&P

PROVIDENT FUNDS - TREATMENT OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO AND MONEY RECEIVED FROM
THE PROVIDENT FUND
For purposes of Income-tax, provident funds are grouped under three heads:
(A) Statutory provident fund
All provident funds which are set up under the Provident Funds Act, 1925 are called Statutory Provident Funds.
Provident funds of institutions such an Universities, Colleges or other Educational Institutions, Reserve Bank of
India, State Bank of India, the Central Government and State Government would constitute Statutory Provident
Funds. In case of Statutory Provident Fund, the entire amount of employer’s contribution without any limit or
restriction whatsoever and the interest thereon received by the employee shall not be includible in the total
income of the employee both at the time when the contribution is made and at the time when the money is
received by or on behalf of the employee on his retirement, death or otherwise. This exemption is specifically
conferred by Sub-section (11) of Section 10 of the Income-tax Act. The employee can contribute to this fund out
of his salary as much as he likes.
(B) Recognised provident fund
All Provident Funds recognised by the Commissioner of Income-tax under Rule 3 of Part ‘A’ of the Fourth
Schedule to the Income-tax Act, 1961 and also Provident Funds established under a scheme framed under
the Employees Provident Funds Act, 1952 are known under the Income-tax Act as Recognised Provident
Funds. For the purposes of being treated as Recognised Provident Fund, the Fund in question must be
recognised by the Commissioner of Income-tax at the time of its setting up and must continue to be so
recognised even subsequently. The moment the recognition is withdrawn by the Commissioner, the Fund
ceases to be a Recognised Provident Fund. The Provident Funds of various Public Sector Undertakings,
Semi-Government bodies and other institutions and organisations including companies which are recognised
by the Commissioner for income-tax purposes, would be treated as Recognised Provident Funds. In the case
of a Recognised Provident Fund, the employer’s contribution to the Provident Fund is not treated as the
employee’s income so long as the contribution by the employer does not exceed 12% of the salary of the
employee. But if the contribution of the employer exceeds 12% of the employee’s salary, the excess of the
contribution over 12% of the salary of the employee is to be treated as part of the taxable income from
salaries in the hands of the employee in respect of the financial year in which the contributions were made by
the employer. The fact that the employee concerned does not receive the money in hand nor is he entitled to
get the money immediately does not in any way affect the taxability of the excess over 12% of the employee’s
salary. The employee’s own contribution qualifies for deduction under Section 80C of the Income-tax Act.
[Salary for this purpose, includes basic salary; dearness allowance/pay (if the terms of employment so provide)
and commission (if based on a fixed percentage of turnover achieved by the employee)]. As regards interest
on the contributions to the Provident Fund, only an amount exceeding a sum calculated at 12% per annum on
the balance standing to the credit of the employee would be treated as part of the taxable income of the
employee. In other words, so long as the amount of interest does not exceed this limit, the interest does not
become chargeable to tax in the hands of the employee.
(C) Unrecognised provident Fund
The Provident Fund which is neither Statutory nor recognised by the Commissioner of Income-tax nor Public
Provident Fund, would be an Unrecognised Provident Fund for income-tax purposes. In the case of an Unrecognised
Provident Fund, the employee’s own contribution to the Fund would not be allowed as a deduction. The employer’s
contribution and the interest thereon would, however, be exempt from tax as and when the contributions are being
made. But when the money in lump sum is received back by the employee, that part of the amount attributable to
the employer’s contribution would be taxable as income from salaries and the interest on the employer’s contribution
would also be taxable as salary income in the hands of the employee. The employee’s own contributions when
received back would not be taxable because they do not contain an element of income. However, the interest
thereon would be chargeable to tax as income from other sources and not as income from salaries.

INCOMES EXEMPT FROM TAX AND NOT INCLUDIBLE IN ‘SALARY’
The following items relevant to salaries have been discussed under Incomes which do not form part of
total income at Lesson 3 of this material and are exempt from tax, subject to the limits applicable for
each:
1. Leave Travel Allowance [Section 10(5)];
2. Remuneration of a person who is not a citizen of India [Section 10(6)].
3. Allowances payable outside India [Section 10(7)];
4. Remuneration of an employee working under the Co-operative Technical Assistance Programme [Section
10(8)];
5. Death-cum-retirement gratuity [Section 10(10)];
6. Amount received in commutation of Pension [Section 10(10A)];
7. Encashment of earned leave [Section 10(10AA)];
8. Retrenchment compensation [Section 10(10B)];
9. Payment received from Statutory Provident Fund [Section 10(11)];
10. Payment received from a recognised Provident Fund [Section 10(12)];
11. Payment received out of an approved Superannuation Fund [Section 10(13)];
12. House rent allowance [Section 10(13A)];
13. Special allowances to meet the expenses of the duties [Section 10(14)];
14. Salary income of a member of Scheduled Tribe [Section 10(26)];
15. Salary income of a resident of Ladakh [Section 10(26A)];

TAX DEDUCTED AT SOURCES
Salaries payable by an employer are chargeable to tax in the hands of the employee and are subject to
deduction of tax at source under Section 192 of the Income-tax Act. The obligation of the employer to deduct
tax at source is mandatory and cannot be negotiated. But in cases where there is any failure on the part of the
employer to deduct the tax at source, the employee cannot escape liability to tax; he would be chargeable to
tax on his entire income from salaries. The fact that the employer could be proceeded against and be subjected
to penalty or prosecution, would not absolve the employee of his liability to pay tax on the income which
should have been subjected to deduction of tax by the employer. In every case, the tax deducted by the
employer should be added to the employee’s income and the gross amount should be taken as the taxable
income of the employee.

Calculation of taxable house rent allowance :
Mr. Ram is employed at Bombay. His basic Salary is ` 5,000 per month. He receives ` 5,000 p.a. as house rent
allowance. Rent paid by him is ` 12,000 p.a. Find out the amount of taxable house rent allowance.
Solution:
As per Rule 2A, the least of the following is exempt from tax :
(i) the actual house rent allowance;
(ii) excess of rent paid over 10% of salary;
(iii) where the accommodation is situated at Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta or Madras, one-half of the amount of
salary due to the assessee for the relevant period;
(iv) Where the accommodation is situate at any other place, two-fifth of the salary due to the assessee for
the relevant period.
Accordingly, Mr. Ram would be entitled to the least of :
(i) ` 5,000 or
(ii) ` 6,000 being excess of rent over 1/10th of salary; or
(iii) ` 30,000 (being one-half of the salary of the assessee).
` 5,000, being the least, would not be included in the total income of Mr. Ram. So the entire amount of HRA
would be exempt from tax.
Salary for this purpose includes basic salary as well as dearness allowance if the terms of employment so
provide. It also includes commission based on a fixed percentage of turnover achieved by an employee as per
terms of contract of employment but excludes all other allowances and perquisites and these are determined
on due basis for the period during which rental accommodation is occupied by the employee in the previous
year.

Determine the value of taxable perquisites in respect of rent free house assuming (a) Mr. Shyam is a Government
Officer and the fair rent as arrived at by the Government is ` 6,000 p.a (b) Mr. Shyam is a semi-Government
employee, and (c) Mr. Shyam is employed by a private company.
Solution:
(a) If Mr. Shyam is a Government Officer : As per Rule 3(1) of Income-tax Rules, ` 6,000 p.a being the rent
of the house as per Government rules, will be the taxable value of the perquisite.
(b) If Mr. Shyam is a semi-Government employee : As per Rule 3(1) of the Income-tax Rules, the value of
the perquisite in respect of rent free accommodation is taken at 15% of salary of the employee (as the
house is owned by the Employer and provided in Mumbai).
Salary = ` 67,800 (` 60,000 + 1,800 + 6,000)
15% of salary = ` 10,170 and
Therefore, ` 10,170 is taxable value of the perquisite.
Further, the value of Electricity expenses and Professional Tax paid by the employer, being perquisites,
are not included in the salary for valuation of Rent Free House Accommodation.
(c) If Mr. Shyam is employed in Private Company : The value of perquisite in this case shall also be `
10,170. Under the new rules there is no difference between the semi-Govt. and other employees.

Notes :

(1) It is assumed that the arrears of project allowance are taxable on receipt basis.
(2) Perquisite in respect of Rent Free house is taxable in the hands of all the assessees. In this case fair
market value has no relevancy (w.e.f. AY 2002-03) and assumed that the house is owned by the employer.
Since the house is provided in Agra, population is assumed as exceeding ` 25 lakhs. Salary for valuation
of perquisite is (` 10,000 + ` 1,800).
(3) The free sweeper, gardener, cook, lunch, car etc. are not taxable in the second case, because Raman
does not fall in the category of specified employee under Section 17(2)(iii) of the Act i.e., he is neither a
director nor his salary is ` 50,000 p.a. or more.
(4) Free lunch provided is not taxable to the extent of ` 50 per day.
(5) Since Raman is employed in a Gas supply company, the value of gas supplied is taxable as cost to the
employer. And it is assumed that the cost of supply is same as ` 400 as given.

Part I – Income under the Head Salaries

153

LESSON ROUND UP
– Basis of Charge: As per section 15, salary is taxable on due or receipt basis whichever is earlier.
Under Section 15 the income chargeable to income tax under the head salaries would include any
salary due to an employee from an employer or a former employer during the previous year irrespective
of the fact whether it is paid or not.
– Different forms of salary:
(A) Basic Salary: Basic salary is taxable in the hands of an employee.
(B) Allowance: An allowance is defined as a fixed amount of money given periodically in addition to
the salary for the purpose of meeting some specific requirements connected with the service
rendered by the employee or by way of compensation for some unusual conditions of employment.
It is taxable on due/accrued basis whether it is paid in addition to the salary or in lieu thereon.
(C) Perquisites: The term “perquisites” includes all benefits and amenities provided by the employer
to the employee in addition to salary and wages either in cash or in kind which are convertible into
money. These benefits or amenities may be provided either voluntarily or under service contract.
For income-tax purposes, the perquisites are of three types:
Tax-free perquisites
Taxable perquisites
Perquisites taxable under specified cases.
Valuation of perquisites: The basic principles governing valuation of perquisites are as follows :
– The valuation is done on the basis of their value to the employee and not the employer’s cost for
providing the same - Wilkins v. Rogerson (1963) 49 ITR 395 (CA).
– The value of perquisite is included in the salary income only if the perquisite is actually provided to
the employee.
– Perquisite which is not actually enjoyed by the employee (though the terms of employment provide
for the same) cannot be valued and taxed in the employee’s hands. Therefore, where the employee
waives his right of perquisite, he cannot be taxed thereon.
– Allowable deductions under the head Salaries: The following amounts shall be deducted in order
to arrive at the chargeable income under the head ‘Salaries’.
(A) Standard deduction: Omitted
(B) Entertainment allowance
(C) Tax on employment or Professional Tax
– Provident Funds are grouped under these heads –
(a) Statutory provident fund.
(b) Recognised provident fund
(c) Unrecognised provident fund

Income from house property is one of the important heads of income under the Income Tax Act. The
tax payers have been, in particular, keen to know about the exemptions and deductions available to
them on repayment of interest and principal of the loan obtained to purchase the house property, if
that house property is let out or self-occupied. The amount of interest on borrowed capital of the
current year is available under the head house property further repayment of principal is available
under section 80C to individuals and Hindu Undivided Families.

160 EP-TL&P

BASIS OF CHARGE
Section 22 of the Act provides as follows:
“The annual value of property consisting of any buildings or lands appurtenant thereto of which the assessee is
the owner, other than such portions of such property as he may occupy for the purposes of any business or
profession carried on by him, the profits of which are chargeable to income-tax, shall be chargeable to incometax under the head Income from House Property".
The following points emerge from the above charging section:
(a) Tax is charged on income from the buildings or lands appurtenant thereto:
The buildings include residential buildings, buildings let out for business or profession or auditoriums for
entertainment programmes. The location of the building is immaterial. It may be situated in India or abroad.
(b) Tax is charged on income from lands appurtenant to buildings :
Where the land is not appurtenant to a building the income from land can be charged as business income or
“income from other sources”, as the case may be. The lands appurtenant to buildings include approach roads to
and from public streets, courtyards, motor garage, compound, play-ground and kitchen garden. In case of nonresidential buildings, car-parking spaces, drying grounds or play-grounds shall be the lands appurtenant to
buildings.
(c) Tax is charged from the owner of the buildings and land appurtenant thereto:
Where the recipient of the income from house property is not the owner of the building, the income is not
chargeable under this head but under the head ‘Income from Business or Other Sources’. For example, the
income to a lessee from sub-letting a house or income to a mortgagee from house property mortgaged to him is
not chargeable under the head ‘Income from House Property’.
The owner of the buildings may be the legal owner or beneficial owner. In ownership, the ownership of building
is considered and not the ownership of income. In certain cases the income may not be received by the owner
of the building, still he shall be liable to tax because he is the owner of the building.

DEEMED OWNERSHIP
As per section 27, the following persons though not the legal owners of a property are deemed to be the owners
for the purposes of sections 22 to 26:
(i) Transfer to a spouse or minor child:
an individual who transfers otherwise than for adequate consideration any house property to his or her
spouse, not being a transfer in connection with an agreement to live apart, or to a minor child not being
a married daughter;
(ii) Holder of an impartible estate:
the holder of an impartible estate as the individual owner of all the properties comprised in the estate;
(iii) Member of a co-operative society:
a member of a co-operative society, company or other association of persons to whom a building or part
thereof is allotted or leased under a house building scheme of the society, company or association, as
the case may be, of that building or part thereof;
(iv) Person in possession of a property:

Lesson 4

Part II – Income under the head House Property

161

a person who is allowed to take or retain possession of any building or part thereof in part performance
of a contract of the nature referred to in Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882;
(v) Person having right in a property for a period not less than 12 years:
with effect from assessment year 1988-89, a person who acquires any rights (excluding any rights by
way of a lease from month to month or for a period not exceeding one year) in or with respect to any
building or part thereof, by virtue of any such transaction as is referred to in clause (f) of Section 269UA,
of that building or part thereof.
Note that :
(1) If a firm transfers its house property to its partners, before dissolution, merely by book entries,
annual value of the property is taxable in the hands of the firm – Inder Narain Har Narain v. C.I.T.
(1980) 3 Taxman 365 (Delhi).
(2) Where a Muslim transfers a property of a value of more than ` 100 it must be by registered instrument
and not orally. This is the position even with respect to a property purporting to have been orally
given over by a Muslim husband to his wife in the discharge of his dower debt to her. Accordingly,
the income from a property thus given will be included in the total income of the husband only –
Syed Sadique Iman v. C.I.T. (1979) 117 ITR 62 (Patna).
(3) In the case of tenant co-partnership co-operative housing societies, the income from each building
should be assessed in the hands of the individual members to whom it has been allotted. Conversely,
for all purposes (including attachment and recovery of tax, etc.) the individual members should be
regarded as the legal owners of the property in question.
(4) Also, for the purposes of Section 22, the custodian should be treated as owner of an evacuee’s
property from the date of its vesting in him.
And, in respect of all properties of an evacuee vested in him, an assessment should be made upon
the custodian, but in respect of properties vested in him, and belonging to different evacuees,
separate assessments in respect of each evacuee should be made upon him.
The relevant status as to residence for the purposes of such assessments, is that of the assesseecustodian and that is resident and ordinarily resident.
The rates of income-tax applicable in any such assessment are those appropriate to the total income
of a “resident individual”.

Other points with regard to ownership
(i) Official assignee or receiver : Where the owner of the property becomes insolvent,the official assignee
or receiver under the law of insolvency shall be chargeable in respect of the income from such house
property as the owner. However, the receiver appointed by the Court shall not be deemed to be the
owner of the insolvent’s property, because the property does not vest in him.
(ii) Ownership in dispute : Where the title to the property is in dispute, the Assessing Officer is empowered
to decide the ownership of the property for income-tax purposes. However, where the decision of the
Court is contrary to the Assessing Officer’s decision, the decision of the court will prevail and he will reassess the assessee accordingly.
(iii) Co-owners of the property : Where the property is owned jointly by two or more persons and their
respective shares are definite and ascertainable, they shall be assessed individually on their shares in
the income from the property (Section 26).
(iv) Owner in the previous year : Since tax is levied only on the income of previous year, annual value of

162 EP-TL&P
property owned by a person during the previous year, is taxable in the following assessment year, even
if the assessee is not the owner of the property during the assessment year.
(v) Status of property in a foreign country : A resident assessee is taxable under Section 22 in respect of
annual value of a property situated in a foreign country.
But, a resident but not ordinarily resident or non-resident is chargeable under Section 22 in respect of
income of a house property situated abroad, only if income is received in India during the previous year.
In such cases where tax incidence is attracted, the annual value is computed as if the property is
situated in India.
(d) Utilised by the assessee for his own business or profession purpose
The annual value of such property or the portion thereof as is utilised by the assessee for the purposes of his
own business, profession or vocation, the profits of which are assessable to tax, is not taxable under Section 22.
The assessee is also not allowed to claim any deduction in respect of notional rent while computing income from
any such business, profession or vocation. However, the assessee can claim depreciation under Section 32 of
the Income-tax Act and also, he can claim other expenses e.g. repairs, insurance, municipal taxes, interest on
borrowed capital etc. for such business income.
(e) Taxability of rental income from a owned house property
Rents or income arising from ownership of any house property cannot be taxed under any other head since
Section 22 provides a specific head for charge of such income to tax. In the case of Commercial Properties Ltd.
v. C.I.T. 3 ITC 23, the assessee company had the sole object of acquiring lands, building houses and letting the
premises to tenants. It was held that the income from property was taxable under Section 22 and not under
Section 28, i.e., profits and gains of business or profession. However, where the subject which is let is not a
mere tenement, but is a complex one, e.g., a well-equipped theatre, safe deposits vaults, or vaults for storing or
preserving films, including special devices, facilities and services or a well-furnished paying guest establishment
- the income cannot be said to be derived from mere ownership of house property but may be assessable as
income from business [C.I.T. v. National Storage (P) Ltd. (1967) 66 ITR 596 (SC)].
Similarly, the following income from buildings is not assessable under this head:
(a) Buildings or staff quarters let out to employees and others: Where the assessee lets out the building
or staff quarters to the employees of business whose residence there is necessary for the efficient
conduct of business, the rent collected from such employees is assessable as income from business
and taxable under the head business or profession and not under this head. [CIT v. Delhi Cloth &
General Mills Co. Ltd. (1966) 59 ITR p.152 (Punjab)].
(b) If building is let out to authorities for locating bank, post office, police station, central excise
office, etc.: income will be assessable as income from business provided the dominant purpose of
letting out the building is to enable the assessee to carry on his business more efficiently and smoothly.
[CIT v. National Newsprint and Paper Mills Ltd. (1978) 114 ITR 388 (MP)].
(c) Composite letting of building with other assets: Where the assessee lets on hire machinery, plant or
furniture belonging to him and also buildings and the letting of the buildings is inseparable from the
letting of the said machinery, plant or furniture, the income from such letting is chargeable to tax under
the head “Income from other Sources” if it is not chargeable to income-tax under the head “Profits and
gains of business or profession” [Section56(2)(iii)].
However, if rent is separable between rent of building and rent for other facilities viz. rent of machinery,
plant or furniture or other facilities etc, then rent of building would be taxable as Income from house
property and rent for machinery, plant or furniture or other facilities would be taxable as either Income from
Other Sources or Profits and gains of business or profession, depending upon the facts of each case.

Lesson 4

Part II – Income under the head House Property

163

(d) Income of State Industrial Development Corporation for letting out of sheds, etc. is business
income and is not taxable under Section 22 – CIT v. A.P. Small Scale Industrial Development Corpn.
(1989) 175 ITR 352 (AP).
(e) Services rendered in providing electricity, use of lifts, supply of water, maintenance of stair case
and watch and ward facilities are not incidental to letting out property, and charges qua said services are
assessable as income from other sources, and not under Section 22 (as income from house property) CIT v. Model Mfg. Co. (P) Ltd. (1989) 175 ITR 374 (Cal.).

DETERMINATION OF ANNUAL VALUE U/S 23
The measure of charging income-tax under this head is the annual value of the property, i.e., the inherent
capacity of a building to yield income. The expression ‘annual value’ has been defined in Section 23(1) of the
Income-tax Act as:
(1) For the purposes of Section 22, the annual value of any property shall be deemed to be:
(a) the sum for which the property might reasonably be expected to let from year to year; or
(b) where the property or any part of the property is let and the actual rent received or receivable by the
owner in respect thereof is in excess of the sum referred to in clause (a), the amount so received or
receivable; or
(c) where the property or any part of the property is let and was vacant during the whole or any part of the
previous year and owing to such vacancy the actual rent received or receivable by the owner in respect
thereof is less than the sum referred to in clause (a), the amount so received or receivable.
Provided that the taxes levied by any local authority in respect of the property shall be deducted (irrespective of the
previous year in which the liability to pay such taxes was incurred by the owner according to the method of
accounting regularly employed by him) in determining the annual value of the property of that previous year in
which such taxes are actually paid by him, i.e., municipal taxes wil be allowed only in the year in which it was paid.
Explanation : For the purposes of clause (b) or clause (c) of this sub-section, the amount of actual rent received
or receivable by the owner shall not include, subject to such rules as may be made in this behalf, the amount of
rent which the owner cannot realise.
(2) Where the property consists of a house or part of a house which:
(a) is in the occupation of the owner for the purposes of his own residence; or
(b) cannot actually be occupied by the owner by reason of the fact that owing to his employment, business
or profession carried on at any other place, he has to reside at that other place in a building not belonging
to him, the annual value of such house or part of the house shall be taken to be nil.
(3) The provisions of Sub-section (2) shall not apply if:
(a) the house or part of the house is actually let during the whole or any part of the previous year; or
(b) any other benefit therefrom is derived by the owner.
(4) Where the property referred to in Sub-section (2) consists of more than one house:
(a) the provisions of that sub-section shall apply only in respect of one of such houses, which the assessee
may, at his option, specify in this behalf;
(b) the annual value of the house or houses, other than the house in respect of which the assessee has
exercised an option under clause (a), shall be determined under Sub-section (1) as if such house or
houses had been let.

164 EP-TL&P
Rules made in this behalf - Notification No. 198/2001 dated 2-7-2001
The amount of rent which the owner cannot realise shall be equal to the amount of rent payable but not paid by
a tenant of the assessee and so proved to be lost and irrevocable only if following conditions are satisfied:
(a) tenancy is bonafide;
(b) the defaulting tenant has vacated, or steps have been taken to compel him to vacate the property;
(c) the defaulting tenant is not in occupation of any other property of the assessee;
(d) the assessee has taken all reasonable steps to institute legal proceedings for the recovery of the unpaid
rent or satisfied the Assessing Officer that legal proceedings would be useless.

Computation of Annual Value/Net Annual Value
Net annual value shall be computed in the following manner:
1. Determine the Gross Annual Value
2. Deduct municipal tax actually paid by the owner during the previous year from the Gross Annual Value.
For the purpose of computation of net annual value, properties can be classified into three categories :
(A) Properties let out throughout the year.
(B) Properties occupied by the owner for residential purposes or properties not self-occupied owing to
employment at any other place.
(C) Partly let out and partly self occupied property.

A. Let-out Propery [Section 23(1)]
Gross annual value shall be higher of
(a) Expected Rent
(b) Actual rent received or receivable.
The higher of Municipal value and fair rental value shall be Expected rent. Therefore, from these Judgments, it
is evident that expected rent shall not exceed the Standard rent.
However, the Supreme Court in Shiela Kaushish v. CIT (1981) 131 ITR 435 (SC) and Amolak Ram Khosla v. CIT
(1981) 131 ITR 589 (SC) held that where property let out is governed by the Rent Control Acts, the standard rent
fixed or applicable to the area of property, will have to be taken for determining the annual value. Also, it was
held in the case of Balbir Singh (Dr.) v. MCD (1985) 152 ITR 388 (SC) that although the expected rent cannot
exceed standard rent but it can be lower than standard rent.

Part II – Income under the head House Property

165

Municipal Value: Municipal value is the value determined by the municipal authorities for levying municipal
taxes on house property.
Fair rent: Fair rent is the amount which a similar property can fetch in the same or similar locality, if it is let for a
year.
Standard Rent: The standard rent is fixed under Rent Control Act. In such a case, the property can not be let for
a amount which is higher than the standard rent fixed under the Rent Control Act.
Actual rent received or receivable: Actual rent is rent for let out period. It is the de facto rent (i.e. what should
have been the actual rent). For example, if water and electricity bills of tenant are payable by the owner, then de
facto rent will be calculated by reducing from the rent received/receivable the amount spent by the owner for
those bills. On the other hand, for example, if any obligation of water and electricity bills is met by the tenant,
then amount spent by the tenant will be included for the purpose of calculating actual rent received/receivable or
de-facto rent. Municipal taxes are to be borne by the occupier who in the case of let out property is the tenant.
Therefore, if such municipal taxes are borne by the tenant, the rent received/receivable should not be increased
to calculate the de-facto rent.
While computing the net annual value the following deduction are made from the gross annual value :
Municipal Taxes : The taxes including service taxes (fire tax, conservancy tax, education, water tax, etc.) levied
by any municipality or local authority in respect of any house property to the extent to which such taxes are
borne and paid by the owner, and include enhanced municipal tax finally determined on appeal and payable by
assessee - Clive Buildings Cola Ltd. v. CIT (1989) 44 Taxman 160.
However, deduction in respect of municipal taxes will be allowed in determining the annual value of the property
only in the year in which municipal taxes are actually paid by the owner.
Where the tax on property is enchanced with retrospective effect by municipal or local authorities and the
enhanced tax relating to the prior year is demanded during the assessment year, the entire demand is deductible
in the assessment year [C.I.T. v. L. Kuppu Swamy Chettiar (1981) 132 ITR 416 (Mad.)].
Even where the property is situated outside the country taxes levied by local authority is that country are deductible
is deciding the annual value of the property. [CIT v. R Venugopala Riddiar (1965) 58 ITR 439 (Mad.)]
While calculating the annual value in accordance with Section 23(1) the following situations may arise:
(i) If the property is let out throughout the previous year (No unrealised rent and no vacancy).
(ii) If the property is let out throughout the previous year, but the entire rent could not be collected.
(iii) If the entire rent is collected but the property remains vacant.
(iv) If the property remains vacant and the entire rent is not collected.
From the above, it can be summarized that GAV would be calculated as follows:
Step 1: Determine Expected Rent and Actual Rent.
Expected Rent = Higher of Municipal Value or Fair Rent but subject to Standard Rent
Actual Rent = Rent for let out period – Unrealised Rent of relevant previous year
Step 2: If actual rent is more than Expected Rent than Actual rent otherwise expected Rent
Step 3: If property remain vacant and annual value decline due to vacancy then such decline value shall be
considered
GAV = According to Step 2 (if no vacancy) and According to Step 3 (if vacancy is there)

B. Property occupied by the owner [Section 23(2)]
Where the property consists of one house or part of a house in the occupation of the owner for his own residence,
and is not actually let during any part of the previous year and no other benefit is derived therefrom by the owner,
the annual value of such a house or part of the house shall be taken to be nil. The only deduction available in
respect of such house is towards interest on borrowed capital in terms of
Section 24(1)(vi) but subject to a ceiling of ` 30,000 or ` 2,00,000 as the case may be.. In other words, to this
extent there could be a loss from such house.
Concession for one House only:
Where the assessee has occupied more than one house for the purposes of residence for himself and family
members, he has to make a choice of one house only in respect of which he would like to claim exemption.
Other self-occupied houses will be treated as if they were let out and their annual value will be determined in the
same manner as we have discussed in the case of let out property.
The concessions in respect of self occupied residential house are available to an individual or H.U.F.
assessee. Firms, companies, etc. are not considered to have used a house for their residential purposes.
A partnership firm using its own building for the residence of its partners cannot claim the concessions in
respect of self occupied residential house mentioned above C.I.T. v. Dewan Chand Dholan Das (1981)
132 ITR 790. Similarly, these concessions are not available in a case where the assessee lets out his
house to his employer and employer allots the same to the assessee for his residential purposes. In such
a case, the assessee occupies the house not as an owner but as a sub tenant of his employer D.R. Sunder
Raj v. C.I.T. (1979) 2 Taxman 458 (A.P.).
In respect of such house, no deduction whatsoever is allowed except interest upto ` 30,000 or `2,00,000 as the
case may be on the borrowed capital. In other words, a loss to the maximum extent of ` 30,000 or `2,00,000 can

170 EP-TL&P
be reported in respect of such houses. If any property is purchased or constructed out of funds borrowed on or
after 1st April, 1999, the restriction on the amount of interest deductible in respect of such self-occupied houses
shall be relaxed so as to secure a deduction upto ` 2,00,000 provided the purchase/construction is completed
within three years [Five years w.e.f. AY 2017-18] from the end of the financial year in which capital was borrowed.
Illustration
Mr. R owns a house which uses for residential purposes throughout the previous year 2016-17. Municipal Value:
` 2,40,000. Fair Rent: ` 3,00,000. Compute income from house property assuming following expenditure are
incurred by him:
Municipal taxes paid: ` 15,000
Repairs: ` 12,000
Depreciation: ` 10,000
Interest on borrowed capital : ` 2,00,000 (loan taken on 1.1.2002). House was purchased on 1.5.2003.

Loss from House Property

(2,00,000)

C. House which is Partly Self-occupied and Partly Let Out:
In such a case, the procedure for computation of annual value is as follows :
(a) Property let out partially :
When a portion of the house is self-occupied for the full year and a portion is self-occupied for whole year, the
annual value of the house shall be determined as under:
(i) From the full annual value of the house the proportionate annual value for self-occupied portion for the
whole year shall be deducted.
(ii) The balance under (i) shall be the annual value for let out portion for a part of the year.
Illustration
Mr. R. owns a house. The Municipal value of the house is ` 50,000. He paid `8,000 as local taxes during the
year. He uses this house for his residential purposes but lets out half of the house @ ` 3,000 p.m. Compute the
annual value of the house.

(No benefit shall be given for self occupied period as the house did not
remain vacant during the previous year)
Note: If fair rent is not gives, then assume actual rent as fair rent.
(c) Self-occupied House remaining vacant :
If the assessee has reserved only one of the houses (owned by him) for his residence or he is the owner of only
one house which is meant for his own residence but could not be occupied by him for residential purposes in the
previous year owing to the fact that he had to live at some other place in a house not belonging to him, then he can
claim non-occupation or vacancy allowance during the previous year for the period during which house remained
vacant. The reason for his living at a different place might be for business or professional purposes or for a salaried
employee due to transfer etc. The annual value of the house, which remained vacant in these circumstances, shall
be nil.
The above mentioned concession will be granted to the assessee only if he has neither let out the said house
nor has derived any benefit from it during the period for which it remained vacant. No deduction, except interest
on borrowed capital upto a maximum of ` 2,00,000 where property is acquired or constructed with capital
borrowed on or after the 1st day of April 1999 and such acquisition or construction is completed within three
years from the end of the financial year in which capital was borrowed.

D. Property owned by co-owners (Section 26)
Where the property consisting of building or buildings and lands appurtenant thereto is owned by two or more
persons and their respective shares are definite and ascertainable, the share of each such person shall be
included in his total income and they shall not be assessed as an association of persons and share of each coowner shall be computed as if each such person is individually entitled to the relief provided in Section 23(2).
Income from property held under trust for charitable or religious purposes is exempt from tax under Section 11.

DEDUCTIONS FROM INCOME UNDER THE HEAD HOUSE PROPERTY
W.e.f. Assessment Year 2002-03, income chargeable under the head “Income from house property” shall be
computed after making the following deductions, namely:

(a) Standard deduction
A sum equal to 30% of the annual value;

(b) Interest on borrowed capital
Where the property has been acquired, constructed, repaired, renewed or reconstructed with borrowed capital,
the amount of any interest payable on such capital:

172 EP-TL&P
Provided that where the property acquired or constructed with capital borrowed on or after the 1st day of April,
1999 and such acquisition or construction is completed within three years from the end of the financial year in
which capital was borrowed, the amount of deduction under this clause shall not exceed ` 2,00,000.
Explanation. – Where the property has been acquired or constructed with borrowed capital, the interest, if any,
payable on such capital borrowed for the period prior to the previous year in which the property has been
acquired or constructed, as reduced by any part thereof allowed as deduction under any other provision of this
Act, shall be deducted under this clause in equal instalments for the said previous year and for each of the four
immediately succeeding previous years (means in 5 equal instalments):
Provided also that no deduction shall be made under the second proviso unless the assessee furnishes a
certificate, from the person to whom any interest is payable on the capital borrowed, specifying the amount of
interest payable by the assessee for the purpose of such acquisition or construction of the property, or, conversion
of the whole or any part of the capital borrowed which remains to be repaid as a new loan.
Explanation. – For the purposes of this proviso, the expression “new loan” means the whole or any part of a loan
taken by the assessee subsequent to the capital borrowed, for the purpose of repayment of such capital.
Amounts not deductible from income from house property (Section 25)
Where the amount of interest on money borrowed for the purpose of house property is payable outside India
and it is chargeable under the Act, it shall not be allowed as a deduction unless:
(i) tax has been paid or deducted at source in respect of such payment, or
(ii) there is a person in India who may be treated as an agent or representative of the non-resident to whom
such payments have been made.

Deduction in respect of interest on housing loan under section 80EE
Keeping in view the need for affordable housing, an additional benefit for first-home buyers is provided by
inserting a new section 80EE in the Income-tax Act relating to deduction in respect of interest on loan taken for
residential house property.
The new section 80EE seeks to provide that in computing the total income of an assessee, being an
individual, there shall be deducted, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this section, interest
payable on loan taken by him from any financial institution for the purpose of acquisition of a residential house
property.
The amount of deduction shall not exceed one lakh rupees and shall be allowed in computing the total income
of the individual for the assessment year beginning on 1st April, 2014 and in a case where the interest payable
for the previous year relevant to the said assessment year is less than one lakh rupees, the balance amount
shall be allowed in the assessment year beginning on 1st April, 2015.
This section will be discussed in detail under Lesson No. 6

NEW SECTION 25A INSERTED VIDE FINANCE ACT, 2016
As per new section 25A applicable from Assessment Year 2017-18, the amount of rent received in arrears or the
amount of unrealised rent realised subsequently by an assessee shall be charged to tax in the previous year in
which such rent is received or realised under the head Income From House Property, whether the assessee is
the owner of property or not in that previous year. Further, assessee is allowed deduction of 30% of such
amount received/realised.

LOSS FROM HOUSE PROPERTY
When the aggregate amount of permissible deduction exceeds the net annual value of the property, there will be
a loss from that property. This loss can be set-off against the income from any other house property. If even after

Lesson 4

Part II – Income under the head House Property

173

the set-off, there is an unabsorbed balance of the loss, the same can be set-off against income under any other
head in the same year and the balance unabsorbed part of the loss can be carried forward in terms of Section
71B for set off within the subsequent eight assessment years against income from house property. However,
where the self-occupied property consists of one residential house only and it could not be occupied by the
owner for the reasons that owing to his employment, business or profession carried on at any other place, he
had to reside at that other place in a building not belonging to him (rented or otherwise), the loss can neither be
set-off against the income from any other house nor can it be set-off against the income under any other head.

Mr. and Mrs. O.P. Gupta are co-owners of a property having equal shares. The construction of the property was
begun in July 1992 and completed in September 1997. They furnished the following particulars for the assessment
year 2017-18 in respect of the property.
One-third of the property is occupied by the co-owners and the remaining two-thirds is let for residential purposes.
The let out portion which constitutes two units fetches rent of ` 27,000 per annum. The letting value of the
property as per municipal records is ` 36,000. Municipal taxes of ` 4,050 have been paid by the co-owners.
Besides, they paid ` 1,350 as ground rent and ` 900 as insurance premium. The co-owners also paid ` 9,000 as
interest on loan taken for the construction of the house.
Compute the income from the house property from the assessment year 2017-18 if other incomes of Mr. and

LESSON ROUND UP
– Charging Section: Section 22 of the Act provides that the annual value of property consisting of any
buildings or lands appurtenant thereto of which the assessee is the owner, other than such portions of
such property as he may occupy for the purposes of any business or profession carried on by him, the
profits of which are chargeable to income-tax, shall be chargeable to income-tax under the head
Income from House Property”.
– Deemed Owner: As per section 27, the following persons though not the legal owners of a property
are deemed to be the owners for the purposes of sections 22 to 26:
(a) Transfer to a spouse or minor child
(b) Holder of an impartible estate
(c) Member of a co-operative society
(d) Person in possession of a property
(e) Person having right in a property for a period not less than 12 years
– The measure of charging income-tax under this head is the annual value of the property, i.e.,
the inherent capacity of a building to yield income. The expression ‘annual value’ has been defined
in Section 23(1) of the Income-tax Act as, the annual value of any property shall be deemed to
be:
– the sum for which the property might reasonably be expected to let from year to year; or
– where the property or any part of the property is let and the actual rent received or receivable by
the owner in respect thereof is in excess of the sum referred to in clause (a), the amount so
received or receivable; or
– where the property or any part of the property is let and was vacant during the whole or any part of
the previous year and owing to such vacancy the actual rent received or receivable by the owner
in respect thereof is less than the sum referred to in clause (a), the amount so received or receivable.
– Gross annual value shall be higher of
(a) Expected Rent
(b) Actual rent received or receivable.
The higher of Municipal value and fair rental value shall be Expected rent. However, expected rent
shall not exceed the Standard rent.
– Net annual value shall be computed in the following manner:
– Determine the Gross Annual Value
– Deduct municipal tax actually paid by the owner during the previous year from the Gross Annual
Value.
– Deduction from Annual Value (Section 24): W.e.f. Assessment Year 2002-03, income chargeable
under the head “Income from house property” shall be computed after making the following deductions,
namely:
Standard deduction: a sum equal to 30% of the annual value;
Interest on borrowed capital: where the property has been acquired, constructed, repaired, renewed
or reconstructed with borrowed capital, the amount of any interest payable on such capital. The interest
on borrowed money pertaining to pre-construction period is available in 5 equal installments commencing

Lesson 4

Part II – Income under the head House Property

from the previous year in which house is acquired or constructed. For this purpose the pre-construction
period means the period commencing on the date of borrowing and ending on 31st March immediately
prior to the date of completion of construction/date of acquisition or date of repayment of loan, whichever
is earlier. Interest for current year is deductible upto ` 30,000/` 2,00,000 as the case may be.

188 EP-TL&P

‘BUSINESS’ OR ‘PROFESSION’
The most important head of income is the head ‘Profits and gains of Business or Profession’. While the provisions
of Sections 28 to 44D deal with the method of computing income under head “Profits and Gains of Business or
Profession”.

Meaning of Business
– The meaning of the expression ‘Business, has been defined in Section 2(13) of the Income-tax Act.
According to this definition, business includes any trade, commerce or manufacture or any adventure or
concern in the nature of trade, commerce or manufacture.
The concept of business presupposes the carrying on of any activity for profit, the definition of business
given in the Act does not make it essential for any taxpayer to carry on his activities constituting business
for a considerable length of time.
– In other words, for even a single or isolated transaction entered into with the idea of making profit would be
a business within the meaning of the definition given in Section 2(13). The concept of business presupposes
the existence of the assessee’s intention to make a profit out of his transactions.
– The object to make profit must be inherent in the transaction although the ultimate result of the transaction
may be such that the assessee had to incur loss. Thus, the assessability of profits and gains from business
under this head does not in any way depend upon the ultimate outcome of the venture or transaction
yielding income or loss.
A loss incurred from business is as much assessable under this head as profit which is chargeable to tax.
There may be cases where a tax payer may acquire an asset not with the idea of selling it at a profit but to
retain it as his own investment. In such cases the profit or gain derived from the sale or other transfer of
such an investment would constitute a capital profit which cannot be charged to tax under the head
‘income from business or profession’. However, if the same assessee who holds some investments,
decides at a later point of time to convert this investment into stock-in-trade and deals with them as part of
his business assets in the normal course of his business, the profit or gain derived from the sale of the
same asset in the ordinary course of the business would constitute income assessable under this head.
The fact that the asset concerned was originally acquired without the idea of making profit on sale, is
immaterial for the purpose of assessment.
Thus, the concept of business presupposes an operation consisting substantially of production or sale or
purchase and sale or making arrangements for the production, sale etc. of commodities. Thus, an agency
which does not involve actual purchases or sale but acting as intermediary would also constitute the
carrying on of a business.
– The definition of business given in Section 2(13) is wide enough to cover every case of transaction entered
into with the idea of earning income.
Example: If a person purchases a piece of land, gets it surveyed, lays down a scheme of development, divides
it into a number of building plots and sells some of the plots from time to time, he would be chargeable to tax not
only on the notional profits made on individual sale of plots but also on the surplus, if any, remaining after the
sale of all plots and after the venture had come to an end.

Meaning of Profession
– The expression ‘Profession’ has been defined in Section 2(36) of the Act to include any vocation. In the
case of a profession, the definition given in the Act is very much inadequate since it does not clearly
specify what activities constitute profession and what activities do not.

Lesson 4

Part III : Income From Business or Profession

189

– According to the generally accepted principles, the meaning of the term ‘profession’ involves the concept
of an occupation requiring either intellectual skill or manual skill controlled and directed by the intellectual
skill of the operator.
– For instance, an auditor carrying on his practice, the lawyer or a doctor, a painter, an actor, an architect
or sculptor, would be persons carrying on a profession and not a business.
– The common feature in the case of both profession as well as business is that the object of carrying
them out is to derive income or to make profit. The process of making the profit would be the main area
of difference between the two while the ultimate object is common to both.

Continuity of Business or Profession
As already mentioned, the existence of continuity in the business or profession is not an essential condition for
making the assessee liable to tax under this head. Thus, receipts arising from the exercise of a business or
profession would still be chargeable to tax under this head although they may be both casual and non-recurring
in nature. In determining the taxability of profit under the head business or profession arising from transactions
of an isolated nature, the following principle should be taken into account to ascertain whether the transaction is
an adventure in the nature of trade:
(i) The transaction is said to be in the nature of trade only if some of the elements of trade are found
in the transaction, the most important being the object of making profit. It is not essential that all
the activities following the main object of the business and which constitute separate transactions
by themselves must be entered into with the idea of making profit. In other words, a person
whose object is to carry on a business may indulge in certain transactions knowing fully well that
he would have to incur loss although he may derive income from the others (e.g. the case of dealer
in shares).
(ii) The purchase of an asset or property with the intention to resell the same may be one of the vital factors
in determining the nature of the transaction but the intention to resell at a profit is not to be taken as the
only factor for this purpose. This is because of the fact that the cases where the assessee has no
intention of enjoying or holding the property, there would be a strong presumption that the transaction is
in the nature of trade although this presumption may be rebuttable in certain circumstances depending
upon the facts of the case.
(iii) It is, however, not possible to evolve a common test or formula which could be applied uniformly
in all cases to determine whether a particular transaction is an adventure in the nature of trade or
not. The nature of the transaction will have to be determined in each case depending upon the
facts or circumstances. The concept of income based upon the principles discussed under Section
4 laying down the principles to be applied for distinguishing between receipts of a capital and
revenue nature must be followed even in cases where income is to be computed under this head.
In other words, the taxability of income under this head depends primarily upon the fact that
the receipt in question is of a revenue nature and is consequently assessable as income under the
Act. However, there are a few cases where capital receipts are also chargeable to tax as income from
business.

INCOME CHARGEABLE TO INCOME-TAX (SECTION 28)
The scope of income chargeable under the head ‘Profits and Gains from business or Profession’ is covered
by Section 28 of the Act which lays down that the following items of income must be charged to tax under this
head:
(i) The profits and gains of any business or profession which was carried on by the assessee at any time
during the previous year.
(ii) (a) Any compensation or other payment due to or received by any person (by whatever name
called) managing the whole or substantially the whole of the affairs of an Indian Company, at or in
connection with the termination of his management or the modification of the terms and conditions
relating thereto.
(b) Any compensation or other payment due to or received by any person, by whatever name called, holding
an agency in India for any part of the activities relating to the business of any other person at or in connection
with the termination of the agency or the modification of the terms and conditions relating thereto.
(c) Any compensation or other payment due to or received by any person for or in connection with the
vesting in the Government or any corporation owned or controlled by the Government under any law for
the time being in force of the management of any property or business;
The three items of compensation for termination of a managing agency or other agency specified above
constitute an exception to the rule that capital receipts are not normally treated as income for the purposes
of taxation. But the fact that these compensations are taxable as business income does not in any way
alter the character of the receipt which is of a capital nature. This is because of the fact that compensation
received for termination of an agency is in replacement of the source of income itself and thus constitutes
a capital receipt.
(iii) Any income derived by a trade or professional or other similar association from the specific services
performed by it for its members.
Trade association means an association of businessmen for the protection and advancement of their
common interest e.g. a Chamber of Commerce. Section 28(iii) does not apply to other social associations
e.g. a sports club or cricket club etc. Similarly the income of a charitable trust from specific services
rendered to its members is not assessable under Section 28(iii) but exempted under Section 11 [C.I.T.
v. South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce (1981) 129 I.T.R. p. 22 (Mad.)].
According to the general principles of mutuality and the principle that no one can make a profit out
of himself, mutual associations or bodies are exempt from income-tax in respect of the net results
of the transactions with their own members. These exemptions generally apply to associations like

Lesson 4

Part III : Income From Business or Profession

191

Chambers of Commerce, Seller’s Associations, Buyer’s Associations, Stock Broker’s Associations,
etc. But according to Clause (iii) of Section 28 which constitutes an exception to the principle of
mutuality, any income derived by a trade or professional association by rendering specific services
to any of its members would constitute income from business chargeable to tax under this head.
Thus a Chamber of Commerce providing lodging facilities to its members would be chargeable to
income-tax under this head in respect of the charges, if any, by way of fees or other payment
collected from the members for rendering such specific services. The services, the income from
which is chargeable to tax, may be those which are rendered in the normal course of the activities
of the association or may be outside the scope of such normal activities. If, however, the income is
derived as a part of usual contributions or subscriptions and not for the purpose of rendering any
specific services to the members concerned, the trade or professional association would not attract
liability to tax under this head.
In the case of any persons carrying on a profession, the value of any benefit or perquisite arising to them from
the exercise of their profession would be chargeable to tax irrespective of the fact whether such perquisite or
benefit is convertible into money or not. For instance, an advocate who in the course of rendering services to
his clients at a place other than his normal place of professional work gets any other benefit at the expense
of the client, he would be chargeable to tax in respect of that amount too. If the recipient of the benefit or
perquisite is an employee of the person from whom the benefit is derived, the value of the perquisite would
be chargeable to tax as income from salaries under Section 15 but not as income from business. The
provision covers only those cases where the value of the benefit is not taxable under the head salaries and
the person deriving the benefit is carrying on a business or profession.
(iv) Export Incentives:

Certificate.
(v) The value of any benefit or perquisite, whether convertible into money or not, which arises from the
carrying on of a business or the exercise of a profession.
(vi) Any interest, salary, bonus, commission or remuneration, by whatever name called, due to or received
by a partner of a firm from such firm.
However, where any interest, salary, bonus, commission or remuneration or any part thereof has not
been allowed to be deducted under Section 40(b), the income under this clause shall be adjusted to the
extent of the amount not so allowed to be deducted.
(vii) any sum, whether received or receivable in cash or kind, under an agreement for –
(a) not carrying out any activity in relation to any business or
(b) not sharing any know-how, patent, copyright, trade mark, licence, franchise or any other business

and lodging.
(viii) non compete fee received/ receivable ( which is of recurring nature) in relation to not carrying
out any profession is brought within the scope of section 28 [Amendment vide Finance Act, 2016
w.e.f. AY 2017-18].
(ix) Any sum received under a keyman Insurance Policy including the sum allocated by way of bonus on
such policy.
Explanation: For the purpose of this clause, the expression “Keyman Insurance Policy” shall have the
following meaning:
“Life Insurance Policy taken by a person on the life of another person who is or was the employee of the
first mentioned person or is or was connected in any manner whatsoever with the business of the first
mentioned person.
(x) any sum, whether received or receivable, in cash or kind, on account of any capital asset (other than
land or goodwill or financial instrument) being demolished, destroyed, discarded or transferred, if the
whole of the expenditure on such capital asset has been allowed as a deduction under section 35AD.

PROFITS AND LOSSES OF SPECULATION BUSINESS
The term speculation has not been exhaustively defined in the income-tax Act, but it normally denotes the
meaning commonly assigned to it in commercial practice. However, Section 43(5) defines the expression
“speculative transaction” as “a transaction in which a contract for the purchase or sale of any commodity including
stocks and shares is periodically or ultimately settled otherwise than by the actual delivery or transfer of the
commodity or scrips”. Where a company (other than banking or financial company) deals in shares of other
companies, the income from such business is treated as income from speculative business.

Transactions not considered as speculative transactions
However, the following four forms of transactions have been specifically excluded from the scope of speculative
transactions:
(i) A contract in respect of raw-materials or merchandise entered into by a person in the course of his
manufacturing or merchanting business to guard against loss through future price fluctuations in respect
of his contracts for actual delivery of goods manufactured by him or merchandise sold by him; or

Lesson 4

Part III : Income From Business or Profession

193

(ii) A contract in respect of stocks and shares entered into by a dealer or investor therein to guard against
loss in his holdings of stocks and shares through price fluctuations; or
(iii) A contract entered into by a member of a forward market or a stock exchange in the course of any
transaction which is in the nature of jobbing or arbitrage to guard against any loss which may arise in the
ordinary course of his business as such member.
(iv) An eligible transaction in respect of trading in derivatives referred to in Clause (aa) of Section 2 of the
Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 carried out in a recognized stock exchange.
(v) An eligible transaction in respect of trading in commodity derivatives carried out in a recognized association
and chargeable to commodities transaction tax.
Therefore, in all cases where actual delivery or transfer of the commodity takes place, the transaction would not
be a speculative transaction, however highly speculative its nature may be.
The above-mentioned five items constitute exceptions provided by the Act whereby transactions such as hedging
contracts entered into by manufacturer and merchants in the course of their business to guard against the
losses through price fluctuations are excluded from the definition of speculative transactions.

POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION WHILE COMPUTING INCOME UNDER THE HEAD BUSINESS
OR PROFESSION
The provisions of the Income-tax Act contained in Sections 28 to 44DB regulate the method of computing
income from business.
The income from business to which a person is chargeable under this head represents not the gross receipts
from the business but the profits and gains derived from there. For instance, in the case of a businessman, the
gross sale proceeds would not be the basis for levying tax but it is net profit or the profit or gain as determined
in accordance with sections 28 to 44DB.

Method of Accounting (Section 145)
The profits and gains of a business are to be computed in accordance with the method of accounting regularly
and consistently followed by the assessee or the method of accounting followed is such that income, profits or
gains cannot properly be ascertained therefrom, the income-tax authorities are entitled to compute the income
of the assessee on such basis and in such manner as they deem fit.
An assessee, for the purpose of his business, may follow the cash system of accounting or the mercantile
system of accounting. Both these methods are well recognised for income-tax purposes and the tax authorities
are bound by the method adopted by the assessee. The tax authorities are not also empowered to reject the
method of accounting regularly followed by the assessee for the purpose of his business except, however, in
cases where the method is not correct, complete or scientific.
An assessee may also follow the hybrid system of accounting for his business or profession. The hybrid system

194 EP-TL&P
is the combination of the cash system and the mercantile system. This is mostly done in the case of professional
men who follow cash system for their receipts and mercantile system for their payments.
As per Section 145(2), the Central Government may notify in the Official Gazette from time to time income
computation and disclosure standards to be followed by any class of or in respect of any class of income.
Further, Assessing Officer may make an assessment in the manner provided in section 144 of the Act, if the
income has not been computed in accordance with the standards notified under section 145(2) of the Act.

Income earned in Cash or in Kind
The income that is chargeable to tax under this head may be realised by the assessee in cash or kind. In cases
where the profit is realised in any other form than cash, the market value of the commodity received as income
should be taken to be the quantum of income chargeable to tax. Even in cases where an assessee is in receipt
of money from his clients or other persons who are under no obligation to make such payment, the assessee
would still be chargeable to tax if these monies were received by him in the ordinary course of business or
profession. For instance, any amount paid to a Company Secretary by a person who has not been his client but
who has been benefitted by his professional service to another, would be assessable as the Company Secretary’s
income from profession.
The person carrying on the business or profession would be chargeable to tax under this head regardless of the
fact that the profits or gains made by him ultimately go to the benefit of some other person or to the business
community or public body as a whole. In other words, the subsequent application of the money derived by way
of income from business is immaterial for the purpose of assessment of the businessman.

Continuation of Business or Profession
The chargeability to tax under Section 28 is based primarily upon the condition that the assessee must have
carried on a business or profession at any time during the accounting year, though not necessarily throughout
the accounting year.
But there may be a few cases (e.g. deemed profits taxable under Section 41) where even if no business is
carried on during the accounting year, the assessee would still be chargeable to tax.

Ownership of Business is not Necessary for Taxability
In order to be taxable in respect of the income of a business it is not essential that the business must be carried
on by the same person who is the owner thereof. Even if the owner authorises some other person to carry on the
business on his behalf or the owner is deprived by the court under certain circumstances of the right to carry on
his own business, the owner will still be taxable under this head.
Similarly, it is not only the legal ownership but also the beneficial ownership that has to be considered. In this
connection it has to be kept in view, as to who is the actual recipient of the income which is going to be taxed. For
example, where a business is acquired for the benefit of a company which is going to be incorporated and the
promoters carry on the business and earn profits during the period prior to the incorporation, if the company
accepts the action of the promoters and receives from them the past profits made prior to its incorporation, the
company shall be assessable under this section in respect of such profits although before the incorporation of
the company the promoters were the legal owners of this business yet as the company was the beneficial owner
(as it has actually received the profits) of the business, it will be assessable on these profits. [CIT v. Bijli Cotton
Mills Ltd. (1953) 23 ITR p. 278].
The tax is leviable on the person to whom the profits accrue or by whom the profits are received. No tax can be
levied on a benamidar in whose name the business transactions are effected and who is not really entitled to the
profits. [C.I.T. v. Thaver Bros. (1934) 2 ITR p. 230].

Lesson 4

Part III : Income From Business or Profession

195

Business may be Legal or Illegal
While profit motive is indicative of the fact that the adventure of an assessee is in the nature of trade and
consequently constitutes a business, it is immaterial whether the business is legal or illegal.
In other words, the taxability of the income from business does not in any way depend upon or is affected by the
taint of illegality in the income or the sources. Income derived from illegal activities is as much chargeable to tax as
income from other operations. The fact that the person who carried on the illegal activities is punishable under the
appropriate law, does not exclude him from the liability to income-tax. However, the loss arising directly in the
course of an illegal business is deductible as business expenditure in computing the profits from that business.
[C.I.T. v. S.C. Kothari (1971) 82 I.T.R. p. 794 (S.C.) and C.I.T. v. Piara Singh (1980) 124 I.T.R. p. 40 (S.C.)].

Profit Motive is not the Sole Consideration for Taxability
There may be assessees who carry on business without the primary object of making profits (e.g., a co-operative
society which tries to cater to the needs of its members without the object of making maximum profits). Even in
such cases, if profits arise from the business carried on by the assessee and such profits are incidental to the
business, the assessee would still be taxable. Therefore, profit motive is not the only test of determining the
taxability of income from any activity constituting business or profession.

Computation of Income Separately for each Business
A taxpayer is entitled to carry on as much number of businesses as he can, both in his own name and in the
name of others. The profits and gains of all businesses or professions would be assessable under this head. But
the profit of each business must be computed separately from one another and the deductions and allowance
permissible to each business must be allowed against the income derived therefrom. The income chargeable
under this head is the aggregate of the net result of the various business or businesses or profession(s) carried
on during the accounting year. Thus, the loss arising from one business would be set off against income from
another business falling under the same head and the net result after such set off would alone be assessable
income under this head. The law does not permit an assessee to club all the sources of his income under the
head and claim a composite amount towards expenses and losses attributable to all the businesses. If an
assessee has incurred an item of expenditure for the purpose of many businesses the expenditure in question
will have to be apportioned against each business for the purpose of allowance.

Computation of Profits of Business or Profession
The profits and gains of business or profession are computed in accordance with the provisions contained in
Sections 30 to 43D. Sections 30 to 37 contain those deductions which are expressly allowed while computing
profits of business or profession. Section 40 provides those expenses which are allowed on the basis of general
commercial principles while computing profits of business or profession. It is necessary to know those principles
before studying the deductions expressly allowed while computing profits of business or profession.
The general commercial principles are as under:
(1) Profits should be computed according to the method of accounting regularly employed by the assessee,
provided that actual profit can be ascertained by this method, whether on receipt basis or accrual basis.
(2) Only those expenses and losses are allowed as deductions which were incurred or sustained during the
relevant previous year and related to business.
(3) These losses and expenses should be incidental to the operation of the business. For example,
embezzlement by an employee during the course of business is a loss incidental to the business.
Similarly, loss from dacoity in a bank is also a loss incidental to the business of a bank.
(4) If a business has been discontinued before the commencement of the previous year, its expenses
cannot be allowed as deduction against the income of any other running business of the assessee.

196 EP-TL&P
(5) There are some essential expenses, though neither expressly allowed nor disallowed, but are deductible
while computing the profits of business or profession on the basis of general commercial principles
provided that these are not expenses or losses of a capital nature or personal nature.
(6) Any expenditure incurred in consideration of commercial expediency is allowed as deduction.
(7) Deduction can be made from the income of that business only for which the expenses were incurred.
The expenses of one business cannot be charged against the income of any other business.

DEDUCTIONS ALLOWABLE
(A) Rent, Rates, Taxes, Repairs and Insurance for Buildings (Section 30)
In respect of the business premises used by the assessee, the deduction is available in computing the income
from business for the following items :
(a) Where the premises are occupied by the assessee in his capacity as tenant, the rent paid for such
premises would be deductible. In cases where the assessee has also undertaken to bear the cost of
repairs as part of the terms of his tenancy agreement, the amount of expenses actually incurred by him
on account of repairs would also be deductible.
(b) If the assessee occupies premises not in the capacity of a tenant but as its owner, a lessee or licensee,
the expenses incurred on current repairs to the premises would be deductible.
(c) The assessee is also entitled to deduct any amount paid by him on account of land revenue, local rates
or municipal taxes in respect of the premises.
Explanation. – For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that the amount paid on account of the
cost of repairs referred to in sub-clause (i), and the amount paid on account of current repairs referred
to in sub-clause (ii), of clause (a), shall not include any expenditure in the nature of capital expenditure.”
(d) Any premium paid in respect of insurance against risk of damage or destruction of the premises, is also
deductible.

Lesson 4

Part III : Income From Business or Profession

Deduction of expenses on the basis of usage:
Section 38 of the Act provides for the allowance of the proportionate amount of the expenses in this regard. It is
possible that an assessee who has taken a building on rent for business purposes may sublet a part of the
same. In such cases, the deduction allowable under the section would be a sum equal to the difference between
the rent paid by the assessee and the rent recovered from the sub-tenant. The allowability of rent payable in
respect of business premises does not in any way depend upon the taxability or otherwise of the rental income
in the hands of the owner of the building. If the assessee is the owner of the building which is used for business
or professional purposes, no deduction would be available in respect of the notional rent which would otherwise
have been payable. But depreciation under Section 32 would be available in respect of such buildings. In cases
where a firm carries on a business in the premises owned by one of its partners the rent payable to the partner
would be an allowable deduction since the firm and the partners are separate entities.
In cases where the assessee uses the premises partly for his business or professional purposes and partly
for other purposes the deduction allowable under this section is a sum proportionate to that part of the
expenses which are attributable to the premises used for business or professional purposes.

(B) Repairs and Insurance of Machinery, Plant and Furniture (Section 31)
– Income from business or profession should be computed after allowing deductions under Section 31 in
respect of repairs and insurance of the machinery, plant or furniture used for the purpose of business or
profession. The deduction allowable would cover the amount of expenses on account of current repairs
and also the amount of any premium paid in respect of insurance of the machinery, plant or furniture
against any risk of damage or destruction thereof.
– The assessee is entitled for deduction in respect of repairs and insurance of these assets only if these
assets have been actually used for the purpose of the business of the assessee during the accounting
year the profits of which are subjected to tax. Thus, if the assets are used in some business, income of
which is not chargeable to tax, the assessee cannot claim deduction in respect of these expenses
against the income from some other business, the profits of which are taxable.
– It is not essential that the assessee must be the owner of these assets in order to claim deduction in
respect of these expenses. Even if these assets have been taken on hire, the assessee would still be
entitled for the deduction.
– On the other hand, if the assessee is the owner of the machinery, plant or furniture and these assets are
held as the assets of the business but have not been made use of for the purposes of the business
during the accounting year, no deduction would be available. But the allowance of these expenses does
not in any way get affected by the fact that these assets are used only for a part of the accounting year
in the business of the assessee.
– The allowance for repairs covers not only the expenses of ordinary maintenance and replacement of
the small parts but also of the renewal or renovation of the asset.
– However, the expenses incurred towards replacement or reconditioning of the machinery or plant or
furniture, would not be allowable under this section because the cost of replacement or reconditioning
of an asset would be an expenditure of a capital nature since it results in the acquisition of a capital
asset or benefit of an enduring nature.
In cases where the assessee incurs expenses in respect of repairs of the plant and machinery of a large
sum in one year and these repairs relate to a number of years which have not been actually carried out,
the deduction allowable under this section would be only in respect of the expenses on current repairs
although the expenses in regard to arrears of repairs may be deductible under Section 37(1).
– The simple test that must be constantly borne in mind is that as a result of the expenditure which is
claimed as an expenditure for repairs, what is really being done is to preserve and maintain an already

198 EP-TL&P
existing asset. The object of the expenditure is neither to bring a new asset in to existence, nor to obtain
any fresh advantage. [New Shorrock Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. C.I.T. (1956) 30 I.T.R. p.
338]. The replacement of the old diesel engine by a new engine in a motor van used for business
purposes was done with a view to preserve and maintain the asset in existence and, as no enduring
benefit was derived by the assessee, the expenditure was allowed. [Nathmal Bankat Lal Parikh and
Company v. C.I.T. (1980) 122 I.T.R. p. 168].

(C) Depreciation (Section 32)
In computing income from business, one of the most important items of allowances is the allowance for depreciation
provided by Section 32 of the Income-tax Act. The deduction towards depreciation is very essential to arrive at
the income of the assessee and also to amortise the capital cost of the amount invested in buildings, machinery,
plant and furniture. The purpose of allowing depreciation is to provide in course of time for the replacement of
asset with the help of the capital cost of the asset which is allowed to be amortised over a period of time. The
provisions for allowing depreciation are contained in Section 32 and are regulated under Rule 5 of the Incometax Rules. The rates of depreciation are also provided in the Income-tax Rules.

Conditions for allowability of Depreciation
In order that the depreciation is allowable, the following conditions must be fulfilled:
(a) Classification of Assets:
The assets in respect of which depreciation is claimed must be buildings, machinery, plant or furniture. In
addition to these tangible assets intangible assets like know how, patent rights, copy rights, trade marks,
licences, franchises or any other business or commercial right of similar nature acquired on or after 1.4.1998
are eligible for depreciation. These intangible assets will form a separate block of assets. As and when any
capital expenditure is incurred by an assessee on acquiring such intangible assets, the amount of such
expenditure will be added to the block of intangible assets and depreciation will be claimed on the written down
value at the end of financial year. While taking into account the depreciation allowance in respect of a building,
only the cost of the building is to be taken into account but not the cost of the land on which the building is
erected because the land does not suffer any depreciation as a result of wear and tear or its usage. Thus, the
term building used in this context refers only to the super- structure and not the land on which it is erected
[C.I.T. v. Alps Theatre (1967) 65 I.T.R. p. 377 (S.C.)]. Roads within a factory compound form part of building
which is used for the purpose of the business and as such are entitled to depreciation. Similarly, residential
quarters provided to the employees are used for the business in the sense that they are used for and such
user is incidental to the carrying on the business. Therefore, the roads to such residential quarters are also
entitled to depreciation at the rates applicable to first class building [C.I.T. v. Kalyani Spinning Mills Ltd. (1981)
128 I.T.R. p. 279 (Cal.)]. However, the M.P. High Court has held that expenditure incurred on construction of
metal roads for approach to trenches to dump the waste and night soil, is capital expenditure. Moreover, such
roads are not plant and machinery. Hence, the assessee is not entitled to depreciation on the cost of the metal
roads [Indore Municipal Corporation v. C.I.T. (1981) 132 I.T.R. p. 540 (MP)].
Plant
The term ‘plant’ for the purpose of allowance of depreciation has been defined in Section 43(3) to include
ships, vehicles, books, scientific apparatus and surgical equipments used for the purposes of the business
or profession. However, on the basis of cases decided by the courts, the following are also included in the
term ‘plant’:
(i) In the case of a hotel, pipe and sanitary fittings [C.I.T. v. Taj Mahal Hotel (1971) 82 I.T.R. p. 44 (S.C.)].
(ii) In the case of electric supply company, mains service lines and switch gears [C.I.T. v. Warner Hindustan
Limited].

Lesson 4

Part III : Income From Business or Profession

199

(iii) Well.
(iv) In the case of manufacturer of oxygen, gas-cylinder for storing gas.
(v) Technical know-how in the form of blue prints, instruction, technical manuals. [C.I.T. v. Festo Elgi Pvt.
Ltd. (1981) 129 I.T.R. p. 499].
(vi) Thermocole insulation. [C.I.T. v. Yamuna Cold Storage (1981) 129 I.T.R. p. 728 (P.&.H.)].
(vii) New Coils. [Panipat Co-operative Sugar Mills Ltd. v. C.I.T. (1981) 129 I.T.R. p. 73 (P.&.H.)].
(viii) Data Processing Machines. [C.I.T. v. I.B.M. World Trade Corporation (1981) 130 I.T.R. p. 739 (Bom.)].
Since the definition of plant is inclusive in nature, it should be taken to cover all goods and chattels, whether
fixed or moveable which a businessman may keep for the purpose of employment in his business with some
degree of certainty and duration of time.
However, following are some of the instances which are not held as plant:
1. Warehouses for storage purposes
2. Horses
3. Human body
4. Bed of River
5. Water storage tanks used for storing water by the supplier for irrigation purposes.
6. Cinema Theaters
7. Hotel Building
Moreover, ‘tea bushes’, ‘livestock’, buildings or furniture and fittings have been excluded from the definition
of plant w.e.f. assessment year 1962-63.
(b) Ownership Vs. lease:
Depreciation is allowable to the assessee only in respect of those capital assets which are owned by him. In
case of a building, the assessee must be owner of the super-structure and not necessarily of the land on
which it is constructed. If the assessee is only a tenant of the building but not its owner he is not entitled for
allowance in respect of depreciation thereof. Where the land on which the building is constructed has been
taken on lease by the assessee, the allowance of depreciation would be admissible only if, according to the
lease deed, the assessee is entitled to be the owner of the super-structure. The fact that as part of the terms
of the lease deed, the building, after expiry of the lease is to be transferred to the lessor of the land would not
affect the allowance for depreciation.
In the case of assets acquired on hire-purchase e.g., plant and machinery taken on hire, the assessee
would not be the owner thereof and consequently would not be entitled for depreciation in respect of the
same. But if the plant and machinery had been acquired on instalment basis, the assessee becomes the
owner of the assets the moment the purchase or sale is concluded and consequently is entitled to depreciation
although a part or whole of the price is payable in future.
(c) Used for the purpose of Business or Profession:
The allowance for depreciation is subject to the condition that the assets on which depreciation is claimed
are actually used by the assessee for the purposes of his business or profession during the accounting
year. The allowance for depreciation, however, is not subject to the condition that the asset in question must
be used throughout the relevant accounting year in order to enable the assessee to claim depreciation.
Thus, even if the asset is used for a very small fraction of the accounting year, the assessee would be
entitled to depreciation in respect of the full amount allowable as if the asset had been used throughout the

200 EP-TL&P
accounting year. Even in the case of seasonal factories (e.g., sugar manufacturing companies), the full
amount of depreciation is allowable if the asset had been used at any time during the accounting year in the
factory. In cases where the depreciable asset is used partly for business purposes and partly for other
purposes, the deduction towards depreciation allowable under Section 32 would be of a sum proportionate
to the depreciation allowance to which the assessee would have otherwise been entitled, in the year in
which the depreciable asset is sold, destroyed, discarded or demolished, no depreciation at the rates
prescribed in the Income-tax Rules would be allowable.
(d) Amount of deduction shall not exceed actual cost: The total amount of all items of depreciation allowance
allowed to the assessee from year to year shall not exceed the actual cost of the block of assets to the assessee.
(e) No deduction on sold assets: No depreciation is allowable in respect of the depreciable asset if the asset
concerned is sold, destroyed, discarded or demolished in the same year in which it was acquired.
(f) In order to be entitled to allowance towards depreciation, the assessee must furnish the prescribed particulars
contained in Annexure ‘B’ attached to the Form of the Return of Income-tax. Any failure on the part of the
assessee to furnish fully and truly all material facts, including the particulars prescribed for this purpose,
would entitle the income-tax authorities to refuse to allow deduction towards depreciation.
(g) The Finance Act, 1995 has deleted w.e.f. assessment year 1996-97 the provision pursuant to which one
could write off the entire cost of plant and machinery in the very first previous year in which it was put to use
provided its actual cost did not exceed ` 5,000, to prevent the widespread misuse of the concession.
(h) The Finance (No. 2) Act, 1996 has rationalised the depreciation provisions, inter alia as follows:
In case of joint ownership of an asset, depreciation would be allowed to each of the owner in proportion to
the contribution to the total cost of the asset; and
In case of amalgamation during the course of a previous year, the amalgamating company and the
amalgamated company shall share the depreciation in proportion to the number of days during which the
assets remained under their respective ownership.
Similarly, in case of demerger during the course of a previous year (w.e.f. 1.4.2000), the demerged company
and the resulting company shall share the depreciation in proportion to the number of days during which the
assets remained under their respective ownership.

Meaning of Block of Assets
The depreciation is provided in respect of “Block of assets”. As per Section 2(11) Block of assets means “a group
of assets falling within a class of assets, being tangible assets such as buildings, machinery, plant or furniture
and intangible assets, being know-how, patents, copyrights, trademarks, licences, Franchises or any other
business or commercial rights of similar nature, in respect of which the same percentage of depreciation is
prescribed”.
Moreover depreciation is now allowed on the written down value of all types of assets. Again, no deduction shall
be allowed under this clause in respect of any motor car manufactured outside India, where such motor car is
acquired by the assessee after the 28th day of February, 1975, and is used otherwise than in a business of
running it on hire for tourists or,
(a) outside India in his business or profession in another country, and
(b) in respect of any machinery or plant if the actual cost thereof is allowed as a deduction in one or more
years under an agreement entered into by the Central Government under Section 42 of the Act.

Important Terms
For the purposes of depreciation, the following terms are important:

Lesson 4

Part III : Income From Business or Profession

201

(i) Actual Cost
(ii) Written Down Value
(iii) Classification of Depreciation
(i) Actual Cost [Section 43(1)]
For computing depreciation, actual cost is the basis in the case of all assets for the first year when the assets
are put to use for the purpose of the business. Subsequently, even in the case of depreciable asset when the
written down value is to be ascertained for the purpose of allowing depreciation, the written down value
should be taken to be the book value of the asset after allowing deduction in respect of the depreciation
allowable under the Income-tax Act from the actual cost of the asset concerned. The actual cost of an asset
is essential for the purposes of allowing depreciation also because of the fact that the aggregate of all the
items of depreciation allowable to an assessee in respect of any depreciable asset shall not exceed the
amount of its actual cost.
The actual cost of an asset to the assessee is normally the amount of capital expenditure incurred in respect of the
acquisition, installation, etc., of the asset and also the expenses, if any, incurred by him to make the asset ready for
the purpose of its use in the business. Thus, capital expenditure relating to the installation of machinery or plant, its
design, etc., would form part of the actual cost of the machinery although such expenses may be incurred by the
assessee subsequent to the date of its acquisition. It has been held that preliminary expenses of revenue nature
necessary for putting plant and machinery in working condition are part of actual cost of plant and machinery. [Shree
Vallabh Glass Works Ltd. v. C.I.T. (1981) 127 I.T.R. p. 37 (Guj.)]. However, if a factory of an assessee is shifted to new
site, the expenses of shifting the depreciable asset or its installation would be capital expenses and would not form
part of the actual cost, because no beneficial asset was acquired or improvement made in the capital assets. [Sitalpur
Sugar Works v. C.I.T. (1963) 49 I.T.R. p. 160 (S.C.)]. Where a plant is constructed or acquired out of borrowed money
by a newly started company, interest paid on the loan upto the date of commencement of production will be capitalised
and treated as part of the actual cost of the plant on which depreciation and investment deposit benefits will be
allowed. [Challapali Sugar v. C.I.T. (1973) 98 I.T.R. p. 167 (S.C.)]
Definition of Actual Cost
The expression ‘actual cost’ has been defined in Section 43(1) of the Act to mean that actual cost of the asset to
the assessee as reduced by that portion of the cost thereof, if any, as has been met directly or indirectly by any
other person or authority. For instance, if an assessee gets a subsidy from the Government for the purchase of
a particular item of machinery, the actual cost of the machinery to the assessee would be total of the purchase
price and the expenses in regard to installation etc. minus the subsidy received from the Government. However,
where any amount has been received as compensation for low output of defective machinery, it will be a revenue
receipt and assessed to tax but it will not be deducted in computing actual cost of machinery. [C.I.T. v. Rohtas
Industries Ltd. (1981) 130 I.T.R. p. 292 (Cal.)]. Thus, the actual cost of the asset as shown in the books will be
different from the actual cost on the basis of which depreciation is allowable.
The provisions of Section 43(1) of the Act clarify that the actual cost of depreciable asset should be determined
in the following circumstances as indicated below:
(a) Assets used in business after it ceases to be used for Scientific Research
In cases where the depreciable asset is used for the business after it ceases to be used for scientific
research related to that business and a deduction has been allowed in respect of expenditure on scientific
research under Section 35, the actual cost of the asset to the assessee should be taken to be the original
cost to the assessee minus the amount of any deduction under Section 35 of the Act, originally allowed.
Note: If capital expenditure for scientific research is incurred after 31-3-1967, the whole of such expenditure is
deductible for the relevant previous year. Hence, the cost of such asset for depreciation purposes shall be nil.

202 EP-TL&P
(b) Assets acquired by way of gift or inheritance
In cases where the depreciable asset is acquired by the assessee by way of gift or inheritance, the actual
cost of the asset to the assessee shall be the actual cost to the previous owner, as reduced by (a) the amount of the depreciation actually allowed to the donor or predecessor in respect of any previous
year relevant to the assessment year commencing before the 1st day of April, 1988, and
(b) the amount of depreciation that would have been allowable to the assessee for any assessment year
commencing on or after the Ist day of April, 1988, as if the asset was the only asset in the relevant block
of assets.
In case where a portion of the cost of an asset is acquired by the assessee has been met directly or
indirectly by the Central Government or State Government or any authority established under any law, or by
any other person, in the form of subsidy or grant or reimbursement, then in case where the subsidy is
directly relatable to the asset such subsidy shall not be included in the actual cost of the asset. In case
where such subsidy or grant or reimbursement is of such a nature that it cannot be directly relatable to any
particular asset, the amount so received shall be apportioned in a manner that such asset bears to all assets
in respect of or with reference to which the subsidy or grant or reimbursement is so received and such
subsidy shall not be included in the actual cost of the asset.
(c) Assets transferred to reduce tax liability
In cases where prior to the date of acquisition by the assessee the depreciable asset was at any time used
by any other person for the purpose of his business or profession and the Assessing Officer is satisfied that
the main purpose of the transfer of the asset directly or indirectly to the assessee was to secure a reduction
of liability to income- tax by claiming depreciation with reference to the enhanced cost, the actual cost of the
asset to the assessee should be taken at such amount as the Assessing Officer may, with the prior approval
of the Deputy Commissioner, determine having due regard to all the circumstances of the case. For instance,
if ‘X’ transfers his machinery on 1.1.1990 to ‘Y’ for a sum of ` 6.00 lakhs while the actual cost of the asset
and the written down value thereof on that day to ‘X’ are ` 3.00 lakhs and ` 1.00 lakh respectively, it may be
inferred that the transfer by ‘X’ to ‘Y’ is made with idea to enable ‘Y’ to claim depreciation on ` 6.00 Lakhs
while the market value of the asset on the date of sale by ‘X’ to ‘Y’ may be ` 4.00 lakhs only. In such a case,
the Assessing Officer would be entitled to allow depreciation to ‘Y’ on the basis of the cost which may be
determined by him to be ` 4.00 lakhs instead of ` 6.00 lakhs as claimed by ‘Y’.
(d) Assets earlier transferred re-acquired by the Assessee
There may be cases where depreciable asset would have once belonged to the assessee and had been
used by him for the purposes of his business or profession and thereafter it might have ceased to be his
property by reason of its transfer or otherwise. If such a depreciable asset is re-acquired by the assessee
himself, the actual cost of the asset should be taken to be the least of either (a) actual cost of the asset to the assessee when it was first acquired by him minus (i) the depreciation
actually allowed to him in respect of any previous year relevant to the assessment year commencing
before the 1st day of April, 1988, and (ii) the amount of depreciation that would have been allowable to
the assessee for any assessment year commencing on or after the 1st day of April, 1988, as if the asset
was the only asset in the relevant block of assets or.
(b) the actual price for which the asset is re-acquired by him.
(e) Building brought into use for business purpose subsequent to its acquisition
In cases where a building which was previously the property of the assessee is brought into use for the
purpose of his business or profession after 28-2-1946, the actual cost of the building to the assessee should
be taken to be the original cost of the building minus the amount equal to the depreciation calculated at the
rate in force at that date which would have been allowable had the building been used for purposes of the
business or profession ever since the date of its acquisition by the assessee.

(f) Asset transferred by holding company to 100% subsidiary company or vice-versa
In cases where any depreciable asset is transferred by an Indian holding company to its wholly owned
subsidiary or vice versa, then the actual cost of the transferred asset to the transferee company shall be
taken to be the same as it would have been if the transferor company had continued to hold the transferred
capital asset for the purposes of its own business.
(g) Asset transferred under a Scheme of Amalgamation
In the case of an amalgamation as defined in Section 2(1B) of the Act, if any depreciable asset is transferred
by the amalgamating company to the amalgamated company, which is an Indian company as defined in
Section 2(26) of the Act, the actual cost of the transferred capital asset to the amalgamated company must
be taken to be the same as it would have been if the amalgamating company had continued to hold the
capital asset for the purposes of its own business.
(h) Asset transferred to the resulting company in case of demerger
In case of demerger, any capital asset is transferred by the demerged company to the resulting company
and the resulting company is an Indian company, the actual cost of the transferred capital asset to the
resulting company shall be taken to be the same as it would have been if the demerged company had
continued to hold the capital asset for the purpose of its own business.
Provided that such actual cost shall not exceed the written down value of such capital asset in the hands of
the demerged company.
(i) Interest Pertaining to Post Acquisition Period
Where any amount is paid or is payable as interest in connection with the acquisition of an asset, so much
of such amount as is relatable to any period after such asset is first put to use shall not be included, and shall
be deemed never to have been included, in the actual cost of such asset.
(j) Actual Cost of Cenvetable Asset
Where an asset is or has been acquired on or after the 1st day of March, 1994 by an assessee, the actual
cost of asset shall be reduced by the amount of duty of excise or the additional duty leviable under section
3 of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 (51 of 1975) in respect of which a claim of credit has been made and
allowed under the Central Excise Rules, 1944.
(k) Asset acquired where portion of cost met by some other person
Where a portion of the cost of an asset acquired by the assessee has been met directly or indirectly by the
Central Government or a State Government or any authority established under any law or by any other
person, in the form of a subsidy or grant or reimbursement (by whatever name called), then, so much of the
cost as is relatable to such subsidy or grant or reimbursement shall not be included in the actual cost of the
asset to the assessee :
Provided that where such subsidy or grant or reimbursement is of such nature that it cannot be directly relatable
to the asset acquired, so much of the amount which bears to the total subsidy or reimbursement or grant the
same proportion as such asset bears to all the assets in respect of or with reference to which the subsidy or
grant or reimbursement is so received, shall not be included in the actual cost of the asset to the assessee.
(l) Asset acquired by non-resident outside India but for business or profession in India
Where an asset which was acquired outside India by an assessee, being a non-resident, is brought by him
to India and used for the purposes of his business or profession, the actual cost of the asset to the assessee
shall be the actual cost to the assessee, as reduced by an amount equal to the amount of depreciation
calculated at the rate in force that would have been allowable had the asset been used in India for the said
purposes since the date of its acquisition by the assessee.

204 EP-TL&P
(m) Asset acquired under scheme of corporatisation of Recognised Stock Exchange
Where any capital asset is acquired by the assessee under a scheme for corporatisation of a recognised
stock exchange in India, approved by the Securities and Exchange Board of India established under section
3 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (15 of 1992), the actual cost of the asset shall be
deemed to be the amount which would have been regarded as actual cost had there been no such
corporatization.
(n) Capital Asset on which deduction has been allowed or allowable u/s 35AD
The actual cost of any capital asset on which deduction has been allowed or is allowable to the assessee
under section 35AD, shall be treated as nil:
(a) in the case of such assessee; and
(b) in any other case if the capital asset is acquired or received:
(i) by way of gift or will or an irrevocable trust;
(ii) on any distrbution on liquidation of the company; and
(iii) by such mode of transfer as is referred to in clauses (i), (iv), (v), (vi), (vib), (xiii) and(xiv) of section 47.
Depreciation is not allowed in case of a foreign car acquired by the assessee after 28th day of February, 1975
and used otherwise than in a business of running it on hire for tourists or is not used outside India in business or
profession carried on by the assessee in another country.
In cases where the assessee acquires the business of another, the original cost of the depreciable asset to the
assessee would be the value at which assets are taken over by him and not the original cost of those assets to
the previous owner of the business. However, in case of succession by inheritance or gift where the actual cost
to the assessee is taken to be the actual cost to the previous owner as reduced by the amount of depreciation
actually allowed under the Act. In cases of partition of a HUF, if depreciable assets are divided amongst the
members thereof at a genuine valuation, the cost of the asset to the member who, after the partition, uses the
asset for the purposes of his business should be taken to be the value at which he takes over the asset.
(ii) Written down value [Section 43(6)]
The written down means:
In the case of assets acquired in the previous year, the actual cost of the assets to the assessee.
In the case of assets acquired before the previous year the actual cost of the assets to the assessee less all
depreciation actually allowed to him in that Previous Year.
In the case of any block of assets the written down value will be determined as under:
Total of written down value of all the assets falling within a block at the
beginning of the previous year relevant to the assessment year

.............

The actual cost of, any new assets falling in the block, acquired
during the previous year

.............

Add:
Less:

Moneys payable in respect of any asset, falling within that block
which is sold, discarded, demolished or destroyed during the
previous year together with the amount of scrap value in respect
of any asset.
The amount of deduction cannot exceed the written down value as
so increased

............

Lesson 4

Part III : Income From Business or Profession

Written down value for the assessment year
Less:

Depreciation during the previous year relevant to the assessment
year

Written down value at the beginning of the previous year relevant to the next
assessment year

205

............
............
.............

The addition/deduction as aforesaid may be made for calculating written down value for the concerned previous
year.
The written down value of any block of assets may be reduced to nil in the following cases:
(i) Where money receivable in respect of assets sold or otherwise transferred during the previous year
plus the amount of scrap value is more than the written down value at the beginning of the previous year
as increased by the actual cost of any new asset acquired.
(ii) Where all the assets in the relevant block are transferred during the year.
Explanation 1: When in a case of succession in business or profession, an assessment is made on the successor
[under Section 170(2)], the written-down value of any asset or block of assets is the amount which would have
been taken as its written-down value if the assessment had been made directly on the person succeeded to.
Explanation 2: Where in any previous year, any block of assets is transferred:
(a) by a holding company to its subsidiary company or by a subsidiary company to its holding company and
the conditions of clause (iv) or, as the case may be, of clause (v) of Section 47 are satisfied; or
(b) by the amalgamating company to the amalgamated company in a scheme of amalgamation, and the
amalgamated company is an Indian Company, then, notwithstanding anything contained in clause (i),
the actual cost of the block of assets in the case of the transferee company or the amalgamated company,
as the case may be, shall be the written down value of the block of assets as in the case of the transferorcompany or the amalgamating company for the immediately preceding previous year as reduced by the
amount of depreciation actually allowed in relation to the said preceding previous year.
Explanation 2A: Where in any previous year, any asset forming part of a block of asset is transferred by a
demerged company to the resulting company then the written down value of the block of asset of the demerged
company for the immediately preceding previous year shall be reduced by the written down value of the assets
transferred to the resulting company pursuant to the demerger.
Explanation 2B: Where in a previous year, any asset forming part of a block of assets is transferred by a
demerged company to the resulting company, then the written down value of the block of assets in the case of
the resulting company shall be the written down value of the transferred assets of the demerged company
immediately before the demerger. Provided that the value of the assets as appearing in the books of account of
the demerged company immediately before the demerger exceeds the written down value of such assets in the
hands of the demerged company, the amount representing such excess shall be reduced from the written down
value of the assets.
Explanation 3: Any unabsorbed depreciation [under Section 32(2)] is deemed to be depreciation actually allowed.
Explanation 4: For the purposes of this clause, the expression “money payable” and “sold” shall have the same
meaning as in the Explanation to Sub-section (4) of Section 41.
Explanation 5: For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that the provisions of this sub-section shall apply
whether or not the assessee has claimed the deduction in respect of depreciation in computing his total income.
Explanation 6: Where an assessee was not required to compute his total income for the purposes of this Act for
any previous year or years preceding the previous year relevant to the assessment year under consideration,

206 EP-TL&P
(a) the actual cost of an asset shall be adjusted by the amount attributable to the revaluation of such asset,
if any, in the books of account;
(b) the total amount of depreciation on such asset, provided in the books of account of the assessee in
respect of such previous year or years preceding the previous year relevant to the assessment year
under consideration shall be deemed to be the depreciation actually allowed under this Act for the
purposes of this clause; and
(c) the depreciation actually allowed under clause (b) shall be adjusted by the amount of depreciation
attributable to such revaluation of the asset.
Explanation 7: where the income of an assessee is derived, in part from agriculture and in part from business
chargeable to income-tax under the head "Profits and gains of business or profession", for computing the written
down value of assets acquired before the previous year, the total amount of depreciation shall be computed as
if the entire income is derived from the business of the assessee under the head "Profits and gains of business
or profession" and the depreciation so computed shall be deemed to be the depreciation actually allowed under
this Act.
(iii) Classification of depreciation
(a) Normal Depreciation [Section 32(1) Rule 5]
Normal depreciation is calculated at the specified percentage on the written-down value of block of assets
(including ocean going ships). Further, where any new machinery or plant is installed during the previous year
for the purposes of manufacture or production of any article or thing, and such article or thing (a) is manufactured
or produced by using any technology or know-how developed in, or (b) is invented in, a laboratory owned or
financed by the Government or owned by a public sector company or university or a duly recognised institution,
then such plant or machinery shall be treated as part of block of assets qualifying for depreciation @ 50% of
written down value subject to the fulfillment of the following conditions:
(i) the right to use such technology or know-how or to manufacture such article or thing has been acquired
from the owner of the laboratory or from any person who has derived the right from such owner;
(ii) the return furnished by the assessee for his income or the income of any other person for which he is
assessable for any previous year in which the said machinery or plant is acquired is accompanied by a
certificate from the prescribed authority (Secretary, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research,
Government of India) to the effect that such technology or know-how is developed in, or the article or
thing is invented in such laboratory; and
(iii) the machinery or plant is not used for the purposes of business of manufacture or production of any
article listed in the Eleventh Schedule (i.e. low priority articles).
For the purposes of above:
(a) “laboratory financed by the Government” means a laboratory owned by any body (including a society
registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 (21 of 1860), and financed wholly or mainly by
the Government;
(b) “public sector company” means any corporation established by or under any Central, State or
Provincial Act or a Government company as defined in Section 617 of the Companies Act, 1956;
(c) “University” means a University established or incorporated by or under a Central, State or Provincial
Act and includes an institution declared under Section 3 of the University Grant Commission Act,
1956, to be a University for the purposes of that Act.
(b) Depreciation on Straight line basis
In the case of Power Units [Section 2(1)(i)] (optional to power generating units) From the assessment year

Lesson 4

Part III : Income From Business or Profession

207

1998-99, an undertaking engaged in generation or generation and distribution of power can claim depreciation
on straight line basis on the acctual cost of individual asset. But the aggregate depreciation can not exceed the
actual cost. Alternatively, such undertaking can claim depreciation, at its option, according to written down value
method like any other assessee. The option for this purpose shall be excercised before the due date of furnishing
return of income. Once this option is excercised, it shall be final and shall apply to all the subsequent years.
Terminal depreciation
If any asset, on which depreciation is claimed on basis of SLM, is sold and the amount by which money payable
together with scrap value, fall short of WDV of such asset, depreciation shall be allowed equal to such deficiency
in the year of sale.
Balancing Charge Section 41(2)
If any asset, on which depreciation is claimed on basis of SLM, asset is sold and the amount by which moneys
payable together with scrap value, exceeds WDV of such asset, then the least of the following shall be taxable
under the head PGBP.
(i) difference between the actual cost and WDV
(ii) difference between aggregate of moneys payable and WDV
(c) Additional Depreciation [Section 32(1)(iia)]
With effect from Assessment year 2006-07 existing clause (iia) has been substituted by new Clause (iia) to
provide additional depreciation in certain circumstances. The additional depreciation shall be allowed @20% of
the actual cost. The conditions and restrictions imposed by this provision are as under:
Under this clause the additional depreciation is available to assessee engaged in the business of manufacture
or production of any article or thing or engaged in the business of generation or generation and distribution or
transmission of power at the rate of 20% of actual cost of eligible new machinery or plant (other than ships and
aircrafts acquired and installed in a previous year. However in case of Investment is made in New Plant and
Machinery in Notified Backward areas in state of Andhra Pradesh or Telangana on or after 1/4/15, Additional
depreciation shall be allowed @ 35% of Actual cost. Additional Depreciation shall not be allowed if –
(a) any machinery or plant which, before its installation by the assessee, was used either within or outside
India by any other person; or
(b) any machinery or plant installed in any office premises or any residential accommodation, including
accommodation in the nature of a guest house; or
(c) any office appliances or road transport vehicles; or
(d) any machinery or plant, the whole of the actual cost of which is allowed as a deduction (whether by way
of depreciation or otherwise) in computing the income chargeable under the head “Profits and gains of
business or profession” of any one previous year.
Note: where asset is purchased in same previous year and put to use in business in same year for less than
180 days then additional depreciation is allowed at 50% of rate of additional depreciation. However in case of
Plant and Machinery purchased and installed in notified Backward areas of State of Andhra Pradesh and
Telangana and put to use for less than 180 days, 50% of additional depreciation will be allowed in previous yr
in which asset is put to use and 50% in immediately succeeding financial year. Additional depreciation shall
not be allowed if –
Extending the benefit of initial additional depreciation under section 32(1)(iia) for power sector
Under the existing provisions of section 32(1)(iia) of the Act, additional depreciation of 20% is allowed in respect
of the cost of new plant or machinery acquired and installed by certain assessees engaged in the business of
generation and distribution of power. This depreciation allowance is over and above the deduction allowed for

208 EP-TL&P
general depreciation under section 32(1)(ii) of the Act. Under the existing provisions, the benefit of additional
depreciation is not available on the new machinery or plant installed by an assessee engaged in the business of
transmission of power.
In order to rationalise the incentive of power sector, it is provided that an assessee engaged in the business of
transmission of power shall also be allowed additional depreciation at the rate of 20% of actual cost of new
machinery or plant acquired and installed in a previous year.
This amendment effective from 1st April, 2017 and, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year
2017-18 and subsequent assessment years.
(iv) Calculation of Written Down Value of a block of asset [Section 43(6)]
(a) Find out the written down value on the first day of the previous year (WDV) relevant to the assessment
year, of all those depreciable assets on which the depreciation is allowed at the same rate. All such
assets are known as “block assets”.
(b) The increase in the WDV by the actual cost of any asset falling within that block, acquired during the
previous year;
(c) Reduce from the above, the moneys payable in respect of any asset falling within that block, which is
sold or discarded or demolished or destroyed during that previous year together with the amount of the
scrap value, if any, so that the amount of such reduction does not exceed the written down value as so
increased; and
(d) In the case of a slump sale, decrease by the actual cost of the asset falling within the block as reduced
by the amount of depreciation that would have been allowable to the assessee for any assessment
year, so that the amount of such decrease does not exceed the written down value.
It means if the net consideration of an asset out of the block is less than the balance under (ii), there would be
no capital gain. If the net consideration of an asset is more than the balance under (ii) (the value of all assets in
the block) the excess shall be deemed to be short term capital gain. If all the assets of the block are sold in the
previous year and the net consideration is less than the balance under (ii), the loss shall be deemed to be shortterm capital loss.
Where any capital asset is acquired by the assessee under a scheme for corporatisation of a recognised stock
exchange in India, approved by the Securities and Exchange Board of India established under Section 3 of the
Securities and Exchange Board of India, 1992 (15 of 1992), the actual cost of the asset shall be deemed to be
the amount which would have been regarded as actual cost had there been no such corporatisation.
This may be easily followed by the following example:
Depreciable assets on 1.4.2014 on which the depreciation is available at the same rate of 25%.
Asset A

3,00,000

Asset B

5,00,000

Treatment of Depreciation in the case of Succession, Amalgamation & Demerger
The fifth proviso to Section 32(1) provides that in cases of succession in business or profession, in the case of
amalgamation of companies or in the case of demerger of companies depreciation of plant and machinery,
buildings and furniture in any previous year shall not exceed the depreciation calculated at the prescribed rate
as if the succession, amalgamation or demerger had not taken place. It also seeks to allow the deduction to the
predecessor and the successor or the amalgamating company and the amalgamated company or the demerged
company and the resulting company in the same proportion as the number of days for which they used the asset
in the business or profession.
Section 38(2) provides that where any building, machinery, plant or furniture is not exclusively used for the
purposes of the business or profession, the deduction under Sections 30(a) & (c), 31(i) & (ii) and 32(1)(ii) shall
be restricted to a fair proportionate part thereof as may be determined by the Assessing Officer.
This section has not been amended to cover Section 32(1)(i) under which depreciation to electricity undertaking
is allowed. Hence, the depreciation for electricity, undertakings claiming deduction under Section 32(1)(i) cannot
be proportionately disallowed under Section 38.
Note 1: No depreciation shall be charged on the block of asset in the following two situations
Situation1 : Section 50(1) when Block of assets is not empty but its written down value is nil at end of the
previous year,
Situation 2: Section 50(2) when Block of assets is empty at end of previous year.
Note 2: Depreciation is chargeable in respect of an asset at 50% of Normal rate of depreciation applicable to the
block to which such asset belongs if the following conditions are satisfied:
Condition 1: asset is acquired during a previous year and it is put to use in same previous year and
Condition 2: asset is put to use for less than 180 days in such year.

(D) Incentive for acquisition and installation of new plant or machinery by manufacturing
company (Section 32AC)
If a company, –
(a) is engaged in the business of manufacture and production of an article or thing; and

210 EP-TL&P
(b) invests a sum of more than Rs. 100 crore in new assets (plant or machinery) during the period 1st April,
2013 to 31st March, 2015, then,
(i) for assessment year 2014-15, a deduction of 15% of aggregate amount of actual cost of new assets
acquired and installed during the financial year 2013-14, if the cost of such assets exceeds Rs.100
crore shall be allowed;
(ii) for assessment year 2015-16, a deduction of 15% of the WDV as on 1st April 2015 shall be allowed.
Sub section 1A has been inserted under section 32AC vide Finance Act, 2014, which provides that, a deduction
of a sum equal to 15% shall be allowed in case of acquisition and installation of new assets (plant or machinery)
on or after 1st April, 2014 provided that the amount of actual cost of such new asset acquired or installed during
any previous year exceeds Rs. 25 crore.
Provided that deduction under sub section (1A) shall be provided only up Assessment Year 2017-18.
Thus, the assessees eligible to claim deduction under the existing combined threshold limit of Rs.100 crore for
investment made in previous year during the period 1st April, 2013 to 31st March, 2015 shall continue to be
eligible to claim deduction under the provisions of Sub section (1) of Section 32AC even if its investment for the
year 2014-15 is below the new threshold limit of investment of Rs. 25 crore.

RATIONALIZATION OF SCOPE OF TAX INCENTIVE U/S 32AC
The existing provision of sub-section (1A) in section 32AC of the Act provides for investment allowance at the
rate of 15% on investment made in new assets (plant and machinery) exceeding Rs. 25 crore in a previous year
by a company engaged in manufacturing or production of any article or thing subject to the condition that the
acquisition and installation has to be done in the same previous year. This tax incentive is available up to
31.03.2017.
The dual condition of acquisition and installation causes genuine hardship in cases in which assets having been
acquired could not be installed in same previous year.
– Now the benefit of this section has been extended even if assets is acquired but not installed in the
same previous however, installation may be made by 31.03.2017. Deduction shall be allowed in the
year of installation.
This amendment effective retrospectively from 01.04.2016 and, accordingly, apply in relation to the AY
2016-17 and 2017-18.

Additional Investment Allowance (Section 32AD)
Additional investment allowance of an amount equal to 15% of the cost of new asset acquired and installed by
an assessee is allowed, if –
(a) he sets up an undertaking or enterprise for manufacture or production of any article or thing on or after
1st April, 2015 in any notified backward areas in the State of Andhra Pradesh and the State of Telangana;
and
(b) the new assets are acquired and installed for the purposes of the said undertaking or enterprise during
the period beginning from the 1st April, 2015 to 31st March, 2020.
This deduction shall be available over and above the existing deduction available under section 32AC of the Act.
Accordingly, if an undertaking is set up in the notified backward areas in the States of Andhra Pradesh or
Telangana by a company, it shall be eligible to claim deduction under the existing provisions of section 32AC of
the Act as well as under the section 32AD if it fulfills the conditions (such as investment above a specified
threshold) specified in the said section 32AC and conditions specified under this section.

depreciation or otherwise) in computing the income chargeable under the head “Profits and gains of
business or profession” of any previous year.
Transfer of the plant or machinery for a period of 5 years has also been restricted. However, this restriction shall
not apply in a case of amalgamation or demerger but shall continue to apply to the amalgamated company or
resulting company, as the case may be.

transferred in any previous year by the assessee to any person, at any time before the expiry of eight years
from the end of the previous year in which it was acquired, such part of the cost of the asset as is relatable
to the deduction already allowed is deemed to be the profits and gains of business or profession of the
previous year in which the asset is sold or otherwise transferred and charged to income-tax accordingly.
But, these provisions do not apply where:
(i) the asset is sold or otherwise transferred by the assessee to Government, local authority, corporation

4. Audit:

214 EP-TL&P
The accounts of the taxpayer should be audited by an accountant as defined in the Explanation below
Sub-section (2) of Section 288 and the report of the auditor is filed along with the return of the relevant
assessment year.
Provided that, in case where the accounts of the taxpayer are required to be audited under any other

the purpose specified in the scheme or deposit scheme. If the amount released by SBI or the amount withdrawn
from site restoration account in a year is not utilized in the same previous year for the purpose for which it is
released, the amount not so utilized will be treated as taxable profits of that year and taxed accordingly.
Where any amount standing to the credit of the assessee in the special account or in the Site Restoration

The deduction allowed under this provision will be withdrawn if the asset acquired in accordance with the
scheme is sold or otherwise transferred within 8 years from the end of the previous year in which it is acquired.
For this purpose, the cost of the asset relatable to the deduction allowed will be treated as taxable business
profits of the year in which the asset is sold or otherwise transferred.
The deduction allowed earlier will, however, not be withdrawn in cases where the asset is transferred within 8
years period to Government, local authority statutory corporation or Government company.
It will also not be withdrawn where the transfer takes place in aonnection with succession of a firm by a company.
For this purpose it is necessary that:

(G) Expenditure on Scientific Research (Section 35)
The term “scientific research” means any activity for the extension of knowledge in the fields of natural or
applied sciences including agriculture, animal husbandry or fisheries. With a view to accelerating scientific
research, Section 35 of the Act provides tax incentives.
(1) Revenue expenditure incurred by an assessee
(i) Assessee himself carries on scientific research [Section 35(1)(i)]
Where the assessee himself carries on scientific research and incurs revenue expenditure, deduction is allowed
for such expenditure only if the research relates to his business.
Pre-commencement period expenses:
Further, revenue expenditure incurred by an assessee on payment of salary to research personnel and on
material inputs during the period of 3 years immediately preceding the commencement of the business is regarded
as having been laid out or expended in the previous year in which the business is commenced only salary is
allowed if it is incurred for 3 years immediately preceding the previous year. Such expenditure incurred in the
period before commencement of business is, therefore, allowed as deduction in computing assessee’s income
of the year in which the business is commenced. The deduction is available only in respect of expenditure
incurred after March 31, 1973 on scientific research related to the assessee’s business. In order to prevent
misuse of the concession, deduction is limited to an amount certified by the prescribed authority. Prescribed
authority as per rule 6 is Director General (Income-tax Exemptions) in concurrence with the Secretary, Department
of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India. The ‘salary’ allowable for this purpose includes
wages, annuity, pension or gratuity, fees or commission, profits in lieu of or in addition to any salary or wages,
advance of salary and annual accretion to the balance at the credit of the employee participating in a recognised
provident fund to the extent to which it is chargeable to tax under rule 6 of Part A of the Fourth Schedule. It may
be mentioned that expenditure incurred on the provision of “perquisites” before commencement of business is
not allowed as deduction. In other words, expenditure incurred by the assessee on providing different perquisites
(such as concessional residential accommodation, or any benefit or amenity provided free of cost or at a
concessional rate etc.) to research personnel before commencement of business is not allowable as deduction.
(ii) Contribution made to outsiders [Section 35(1)(ii) & (iii)]
Where the assessee does not himself carry on scientific research but makes contributions to other institutions
for this purposes deduction is allowed, if:
(a) the payment is made to an approved research association which has, as its object, undertaking of
research related or unrelated to the business of assessee, a deduction of 175% of expenditure incurred
is allowed.[Section 35(1)(ii)];
(b) the payment is made to an approved university, college or institution to be used for scientific research
related or unrelated to the business of assessee [Section 35(1)(ii)], deduction shall be allowed to the
extent of 175% of the actual expenditure. [From AY 2018-19 to AY 2020-21 deduction shall be 150%
of actual contribution and from AY 2021-22 Deduction shall be 100% of actual contribution –
Amendment vide Finance Act, 2016].
(c) the payment is made to an approved company to be used by it for scientific research, deduction shall be
allowed to the extent of 125% of the sum paid provided such company;

216 EP-TL&P
(i) is registered in India,
(ii) has as its main object the scientific research and development,
(iii) is, for the purposes of this clause, for the time being approved by the prescribed authority in the
prescribed manner, and
(iv) fulfills such other conditions as may be prescribed.
a deduction of 125% of the sum paid shall be allowed as deduction. [Section 35(1)(iia)] [w.e.f AY 201819 deduction shall be 100% of actual contribution made – Amendment vide Finance Act, 2016].
(d) the payment is made to a research association which has its object the undertaking of research in social
science or statistical research or to a university, college or institution for the use of research in social
sciences or statistical research, related or unrelated to the business of the assessee provided such
university, college or institution is, for the time being, approved by the Central Government by notification
in the Official Gazette [Section 35(1)(iii)], deduction shall be allowed to the extent of 125% of the sum
paid.
The approval to research association, university, college or institution mentioned above is required to
be obtained from the Central Government as provided by Finance Act, 1999 w.e.f. 1.4.2000.
The deduction available for such payments mentioned in clauses (a), (b) and (c) above to the extent of
one and one-fourth times of any sum paid; with effect from Assessment Year 2000-01. [w.e.f AY 201819 deduction shall be 100% of actual contribution made – Amendment vide Finance Act, 2016].
(2) Capital expenditure on scientific research
(i) Incurred by the assessee himself: Expenditure of a capital nature on scientific research related to the
business carried on by the assessee is also allowable to the following extent:
(a) Where the capital expenditure is incurred after March 31, 1967, the whole of the capital expenditure
incurred in any previous year is deductible for that previous year. However, expenditure incurred on the
acquisition of any land, whether acquired as such or part of any property, after 29.2.1984, is not deductible.
(b) Capital expenditure incurred before the commencement of the business is deemed to have been incurred
in the previous year in which the business is commenced, to the extent of the aggregate of the expenditure
so incurred within the three years immediately preceding the commencement of the business.
Where an asset representing expenditure of a capital nature incurred before 1.4.1967, ceases to be used in a
previous year for scientific research related to the business and the value of the asset at the time of the cessation,
together with the aggregate of deductions already allowed falls short of the said expenditure then - (i) the
deficiency is allowable as a deduction for the relevant previous year. Thereafter, no further deduction is allowable
for any subsequent previous year.
Also in the case of sale of such assets, without use thereof for other purposes, in the year of cessation, the sale
price shall be taken to be the value of the asset at the time of cessation and if the asset is sold without having
been used for other purposes, in a previous year subsequent to the year of cessation and the sale price falls
short of the value of the asset taken into account at the time of cessation, the deficiency shall be allowed as a
deduction for the previous year in which the sale took place.
Deduction by way of depreciation is not admissible in respect of an asset used in scientific research either in the
year in which the capital expenditure is incurred or in a subsequent year. However, in the event of use of such
assets for business, after cessation of use thereof for scientific research related to that business, the same
asset shall become entitled to depreciation.
(ii) Carry forward and set off of deficiency in subsequent years:
If on account of inadequacy or absence of profits of the business, deduction on account of capital expenditure

Lesson 4

Part III : Income From Business or Profession

217

referred to in Section 35(1)(iv) of the Act cannot be allowed, fully or partly, the deficiency so arising is to be
carried forward for 8 years and set off in any subsequent assessment year. However, carry forward of deficiency
is subject to the condition that business loss already brought forward, if any, will have precedence over such
deficiency in the matter of set off. To put it little differently, the aforesaid deficiency will be given the same
treatment as is given to unabsorbed depreciation vis-a-vis brought forward business losses.
(iii) Consequences in case of amalgamation:
In pursuance of an agreement of amalgamation, if the amalgamating company transfers to the amalgamated
company, which is an Indian company, any asset representing capital expenditure on scientific research, provisions
of Section 35 would apply to the amalgamated company as they would have applied to the amalgamating
company if the latter had not transferred the asset.
To avail the benefit of this section, the following procedures have also to be complied with:
– The research association, university, college or other institution makes an application in the prescribed
form and manner to the Central Government for grant of approval or continuance of the scientific research.
– Before grant of the approval so sought, the Central Government may call for such documents including
audited annual accounts or information from the research association, university, college, or other
institution as it thinks necessary to satisfy itself about the genuineness of the activities of the research
association, university, college or other institution. The prescribed authority is also empowered to
make such inquiries as it may deem necessary, in this behalf, and
– The notification issued by the Central Government shall have effect for such assessment year or
years, upto a maximum of three assessment years, including the assessment year or years commencing
before the date on which the notification is issued, as may be specified in the notification.
Any question as to what extent an activity constitutes scientific research or any asset was being used for scientific
research, if arises it will be referred to the prescribed authority and its decision shall be final.
However, any such question relating to any activity of research association or university, college or other institution
for which weighted deduction of one and one-fourth times the payment amount is given and for which approval
from Central Government is required to be obtained, the question is also required to be referred to Central
Government only and not to prescribed authority.
(3) Contribution to National Laboratory [section 35(2AA)]
Where any sum is paid to a National Laboratory, approved for this purpose by the Indian Council of Agricultural
Research or the Indian Council of Medical Research or the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research etc., or
to any University, or to Indian Institute of Technology, a weighted deduction of 200% of the sum paid shall be
allowed as deduction under Section 35(2AA) of the Act. [The deduction shall be 150% of actual contribution
made for AY 2018-19 to AY 2020-21 and 100% of actual contribution made from AY 2021-22 - Amendment
vide Finance Act, 2016].
(4) Expenditure on in-house research and development expenses [Section 35(2AB)]
Where a company engaged in the business of bio-technology or in any business of manufacture or production
of any article or thing, not being an article or thing specified in the list of the Eleventh Schedule incurs any
expenditure on scientific research (not being expenditure in the nature of cost of any land or building) on inhouse research and development facility as approved by the prescribed authority, then, there shall be allowed a
deduction of a sum equal to 200% of the expenditure so incurred upto 31.03.2017.
Deduction under this section shall be allowed if the company enters into an agreement with the prescribed
authority for cooperation in such research and development facility and fulfills prescribed conditions with regard
to maintenance and audit of accounts and also furnishes prescribed reports. Such report is to be submitted to

218 EP-TL&P
Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner having jurisdiction over the company claiming the weighted
deduction under this section. [The deduction shall be 150% of actual contribution made for AY 2018-19 to AY
2020-21 and 100% of actual contribution made from AY 2021-22 - Amendment vide Finance Act, 2016].

(H) Expenditure on Acquisition of Patent Rights or Copyrights (Section 35A)
Capital expenditure incurred by all assessees at any time after 28.2.1966 but before 1st April, 1998 for the
purpose of acquisition of patent rights or copyrights for the purposes of his business, would be allowed to be
amortised over a period of 14 years in equal instalments beginning with the previous year in which such expenditure
is incurred or where such expenditure is incurred before the commencement of the business, the fourteen
previous years would be calculated from the previous year in which the business commenced. With effect from
1.4.98 depreciation on intangible assets has been introduced. It is charged @25%. In view of this change
expenditure under this section need not be amortised if incurred after the given date. However, where the rights
became effective in a year prior to the one in which the expenditure is incurred, the deduction would be allowable
to the assessee in respect of that period as remains unexpired. In other words, if at the time of acquisition
(incurring the expenses) of the patent, say, the patent has already been utilized for 10 years by the assessee,
the cost of the patent would be allowed as a deduction in four equal instalments in the remaining four years. In
cases where the assessee acquires the patent or copyright at a time when only one year of its life remains, the
entire cost of the patent to the assessee would be allowed in the year of acquisition itself. The other provisions
relating to the allowance of deduction in respect of capital expenditure incurred for acquiring patents or copyrights
are as under:
(i) Where a part of the right is sold and the proceeds of the sale are not less than the cost of acquisition
thereof remaining unallowed, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of the previous year in which a
part is so sold and in respect of any subsequent previous year.
(ii) Where the rights either come to an end or are sold in their entirety and the proceeds of sale are less
than the cost of acquisition thereof remaining unallowed, a deduction equal to such cost remaining
unallowed or as the case may be such cost remaining unallowed, as reduced by the proceeds of the
sale, shall be allowed in the year in which rights come to an end or are sold.
(iii) Where the whole or any part of the rights is sold at a profit, the profits shall be chargeable as balancing
charge. In case of the sale of the rights in the year in which the business is no longer in existence, the
profits shall be chargeable as if the business is in existence in that previous year.
(iv) Where a part of the rights is sold and (iii) above does not apply the amount of deduction for that year and
the subsequent year shall be calculated as follows:
(a) subtract the proceeds of sale from the cost of acquisition of the rights remaining unallowed; and
(b) divide the remainder by the number of previous year which have not expired at the beginning of the
year in which the rights are sold.
(v) In case of amalgamation of companies, the amalgamated company (being an Indian company) is entitled
to continuation of benefits in the same way as amalgamating company would have enjoyed, if it has not
so sold or otherwise transferred the rights.
Similarly, in case of demerger of companies, the resulting company (being an Indian company) is entitled to
continuation of benefits in the same way as demerged company would have enjoyed, if it had not so sold or
otherwise transferred the rights.
Note : Now, no dedection under this section is allowed.

(I) Deduction in respect of expenditure on know-how (Section 35AB)
Any lump sum consideration paid by the assessee in any previous year relevant to the assessment year
commencing on or before 1st April, 1998 for acquiring any know-how for use for the purpose of his business will
be allowed as deduction by spreading it equally over six years, namely, the year in which the lump sum
consideration is paid and the five immediately succeeding years. With effect from 1.4.98 depreciation on intangible
assets has been introduced and charged @ 25%. In view of this change expenditure under this section is not to
be amortised if incurred after the given date. Where the know-how is developed in a laboratory, University or
institution etc., the consideration shall be spread equally over 3 years. In case of transfer of business under the
scheme of amalgamation or demerger where amalgamating or the demerged company is entitled to a deduction
under this section, then the amalgamated company or the resulting company, as the case may be shall be
entitled to claim deduction under this sub- section for the residual period as if the business or the undertaking
had continued. For the purpose of this section “know-how” means any industrial information or technique likely
to assist in the manufacture or processing of goods or in the working of a mine, oil well or other sources of
mineral deposits (including searching for, discovery or testing of deposits or winning of access thereto).
Now a days no deduction is available under section 35AB.

AMORTIZATION OF SPECTRUM FEES FOR PURCHASE OF SPECTRUM [NEW SECTION 35ABA
INSERTED VIDE FINANCE ACT, 2016]
New section 35ABA is inserted to provide amortization of amount paid on the acquisition of any right to use
spectrum for telecommunication services by paying spectrum fees. The section provides :
i. Any capital expenditure incurred and actually paid by the assessee on acquisition of any right ot use
spectrum for Telecom services by paying spectrum fee will be allowed as deduction in equal instalments.
Deduction will start from the year in which payment is made (or the year of commencement of business,
whichever is later) and ending with the year in which spectrum comes to an end, irrespective of the
previous year in which liability for expenditure was incurred according to the method of accounting
regularly followed by assessee or payable in such manner as may be prescribed.
ii. Where the spectrum is transferred and the proceeds of transfer are less than the expenditure remaining
unallowed, a deduction equal to the expenditure remaining unallowed as reduced by the proceeds of
transfer, shall be allowed in the year of transfer of spectrum.
iii. If spectrum is transferred and proceeds of transfer exceed the amount of expenditure remaining unallowed,
the excess amount (to the extent it does not exceed deduction claimed u/s 35ABA) shall be chargeable to
tax as profits and gains of business in the previous year in which such spectrum has been transferred.
iv. Unallowed expenditure in a case where a part of spectrum is transferred would be amortised.
v. Where the deduction has been claimed and granted to the assessee in accordance with the provisions
of this section and, subsequently, there is failure to comply with any of the provisions of this section,
then the deduction shall be deemed to have been wrongly allowed. In such case, the assessing officer
can re-compute the total income of the assessee for the previous year (in which deduction was claimed)
and make necessary rectification. Such rectification can be made within 4 years from the end of the
previous year in which failure takes place.
vi. Under the scheme of amalgamation , if the amalgamating company sells or transfers the spectrum to an
amalgamated company, being an Indian company, then the provisions of this section shall apply the
amalgamated company as they would have applied to the amalgamating company if later had not
transferred the spectrum. Similar rule will be applicable in case of demerger.
Where, in a previous year, any deduction has been claimed and granted to the assessee under sub-section (1),
and, subsequently, there is failure to comply with any of the provisions of this section, then, –

220 EP-TL&P
(a) the deduction shall be deemed to have been wrongly allowed;
(b) the Assessing Officer may, notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, re-compute the total income
of the assessee for the said previous year and make the necessary rectification;
(c) the provisions of section 154 shall, so far as may be, apply and the period of four years specified in subsection (7) of that section being reckoned from the end of the previous year in which the failure to
comply with the provisions of this section takes place.
These amendments effective from 1st April, 2017 and accordingly apply in relation to the assessment
year 2017-18 and subsequent years.

(J) Expenditure on telecom licence (Section 35ABB)
Where any capital expenditure is incurred by the assessee for acquiring any right to operate telecommunications
services and for which payment has actually been made to obtain a licence, a deduction will be allowed in equal
instalments over the period for which the licence remains in force, subject to the following:
(a) If the fee is paid for acquiring any right to operate telecommunications services before the commencement
of such business, the deduction shall be allowed for the previous years beginning with the previous year
in which such business is commenced.
(b) If the fee is paid for acquiring such rights after the commencement of such business the deduction shall
be allowed for the previous years beginning with the previous year in which the license fee is actually
paid (irrespective of the previous year in which the liability for the expenditure is incurred).
Profit/loss on Sale – Where the licence is transferred and proceeds of transfer (sale proceeds) are less than the amount of
expenditure incurred remaining unallowed:
(i) Where whole of the licence is transferred in a previous year. Deduction as given below shall be allowed
in the previous year in which the licence is transferred.
Expenditure remaining unallowed less sale proceeds.
(ii) Where part of the licence is transferred in a previous year. Deduction as given below shall be allowed in
the balance number of relevant previous years.
(expenditure remaining unallowed less sale proceeds) divided by balance number of relevant previous
years, i.e., the previous years not expired at the beginning of the year of transfer.
– Where the licence is transferred and the proceeds of transfer (sale proceeds) exceed the amount of
expenditure incurred remaining unallowed.
Sale proceeds less expenditure remaining unallowed subject to deductions already allowed shall be
chargeable to income tax as profits and gains of the business in the previous year in which licence is
transferred. Consequently, no further deduction in the previous year in which licence is transferred or in any
subsequent previous years is allowed.
Where licence is transferred in a previous year in which the business is no longer in existence, the provisions
of this sub-section shall apply as if the business is in existence in that previous year.
– Where under a scheme of amalgamation a telecom licence is transferred by the amalgamating company to
the amalgamated company (being an Indian company), then deduction will not be available under this
section to the amalgamating company, instead the provisions of this Section (35ABB) will continue to apply
to the amalgamated company as they would have applied to the amalgamating company if the latter had not
transferred the licence.
– Similarly in a scheme of demerger a telecom licence is transferred by the demerged company to the resulting
company, then deduction will not be available to the demerged company and will instead apply to the resulting

Lesson 4

221

company as they would have applied to the demerged company if the latter had not transferred the licence.
Further where a deduction for any previous year is claimed and allowed under Section 35ABB, then no
deduction under Section 32(1) shall be allowed for the same or any subsequent previous year.

eligible project or scheme.
In order to claim deduction the assessee has to furnish along with his return of income a certificate –
(a) from the public sector company, or local authority or as the case may be association or institution where
the payment is made through these bodies.
(b) in any other case (like payment made directly by a company on the eligible projects in scheme) from a
Chartered Accountant.
in such manner, form and containing such particulars as may be prescribed.
Further, a deduction under this section if, is claimed and allowed for any assessment year, disentitles the assessee
from claiming deduction in respect of such expenditure under any other provision of this Act for the same or any
other assessment year.]

Sums paid on or before 31.3.2002 by an assessee carrying on business or profession to an approved
association or institution which has as its object the undertaking of any programme of conservation of Natural
resources (or of afforestation w.e.f. the assessment year 1991-92) to be used for such programme, are allowed

provision is not allowed unless the association or institution is for the time being approved by the prescribed
authority. As per Rule 6AAC, the prescribed authority for this purpose is Secretary, Department of Environment,
Government of India. Further, the prescribed authority shall not grant such approval for more than three years
at a time.

(Q) Amortisation of Preliminary Expenses (Section 35D)
Under Section 35D, Indian companies and other non-corporate taxpayers resident in India would be entitled to
amortisation of certain preliminary expenses incurred by them at any time after 31.3.1970.
The expenditure which qualifies for amortisation should have been incurred by the assessee:
(i) before the commencement of his business,
(ii) if however, the expenditure is incurred after the commencement of business, it is essential that the expenditure
should be in connection with the extension or expansion of the undertaking of the assessee or in connection
with the setting up of a new unit by the assessee.
Amount of Deduction:
The amount qualifying for amortisation would be allowable as a deduction in five equal instalments beginning
with the previous year in which the business of the assessee actually commences or the previous year in which
the extension of the present undertaking is completed or the new unit commences production or operation, as
the case may be.

226 EP-TL&P
Qualifying amount of expenses:
The following items of expenses qualify for amortisation under this section as preliminary expenses:
(i) expenditure incurred by the assessee in connection with the preparation of feasibility report or project
report;
(ii) expenses for conducting market survey or any other survey necessary for the purpose of the business
of the assessee;

Taxes may prescribe for the purpose of amortisation under this section.
Note: Work mentioned in (i) to (iii) above must be carried out by assessee himself or by a concern approved by CBDT.

Amount qualifying for deduction:
The maximum amount allowable as preliminary expenses qualifying for amortisation should be restricted to an
amount calculated at 5% of (a) the cost of the project, or (b) where the assessee is an Indian Company, at the
option of the company, of the capital employed in the business of the company or cost of project.
Cost of the Project
For the purpose of amortisation, the expression “Cost of the Project” in relation to the expenses incurred
before the commencement of the business means the actual cost of the fixed assets being land, buildings,
lease holds, plant, machinery, furniture, fittings and railway sidings, including expenditure on the development
of land and buildings, which are shown in the books of accounts of the assessee as on the last day of the
accounting year in which the business of the assessee actually commences. Where the expenses are incurred
after the commencement of business either in connection with the extension of the present undertaking or in
connection with the setting up of a new unit, the cost of the project should be taken to mean the actual cost of
the fixed assets, being land, buildings, lease holds, plant, machinery, furniture, fittings and railway sidings,
including expenditure on the development of the land and building which are shown in the books of the
assessee as on the last day of the previous year in which extension of the undertaking is completed or the
new unit commences production or operations, as the case may be, to the extent to which such fixed assets
have been acquired or developed in connection with the extension of the undertaking or the setting up of the
new unit of the assessee.
Capital Employed
In the case of company, the capital employed in the business means where preliminary expenses have been
incurred before the commencement of the business, the aggregate of the issued share capital, debentures and
long-term borrowings as on the last day of the accounting year in which the business of the company has
actually commenced. In cases where the expenditure has been incurred after the commencement of the business,

Lesson 4

Part III : Income From Business or Profession

227

the capital employed in the business of the company should be taken to be the aggregate of the issued share
capital, debentures and long-term borrowings as on the last day of the accounting year in which the extension of
the undertaking is completed or, as the case may be, the new unit commences production or operation, to the
extent to which the capital, debentures and long-term borrowings have been issued or obtained in connection
with the extension of the undertaking or setting up of the new unit of the company.
Meaning of the long-term borrowings
The expression ‘long-term borrowings’ to be included as part of the capital employed in the business of the
company should be taken to mean:
(i) any moneys borrowed by the company from the Government or the Industrial Finance Corporation of
India or Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India or any other financial institution which is
eligible for deduction under Section 36(1)(vii) of the Act or any banking institution; or
(ii) any moneys borrowed or debt incurred by the company in a foreign country in respect of the purchases
outside India of capital plant and machinery where the terms of the borrowing provide for repayment of
the money borrowed or debt incurred over a period of not less than seven years.
In case of person other than a company or a co-operative society
The allowance towards amortisation of preliminary expenses is subject to the condition that the accounts of the
assessee for the year or years in which the preliminary expenses are incurred have been audited by a Chartered
Accountant or other accountant specified in Section 288(2) of the Act and, in addition, the assessee furnishes
along with his return of income for the first year in which the deduction is claimed the report of audit in the
prescribed form, duly signed and verified by the auditor and setting out such other particulars as have been
prescribed by the Board for this purpose.
In case of Amalgamation/Demerger
In cases of amalgamation as defined in Section 2(1B) of the Act, the amalgamating company would not be
entitled to the allowance towards amortisation of preliminary expenses in the year in which the amalgamation
takes places. But the amalgamated company would be entitled to the allowance for the remaining period over
which the allowance under this section is available. The total period over which the amortisation is allowable
should not exceed ten years or five years as the case may be in the case of both the amalgamating company
and the amalgamated company. The allowance under this section would not be denied, in cases of amalgamation,
to the amalgamated company merely because the expenditure has not actually been incurred by the amalgamated
company. Similarly, in case of demerger where an undertaking of an Indian company which is entitled to the
deduction under this section is transferred before the expiry of the said period of 10 years or 5 years (as the
case may be), to another company in a scheme of demerger no deduction shall be admissible to the demerged
company in the year in which the demerger takes place. The resulting company would be entitled to claim
deduction for the balance period under this section. In other words, the deduction for the balance period will be
available to resulting company as it would have been available to demerged company, if the demerger had not
taken place. In cases where preliminary expenses qualify for amortisation under Section 35D and the allowance
claimed by the assessee in this regard is allowed in any assessment year, these expense would not qualify for
any allowance or deduction in respect of any other assessment year or even in the same year under any other
provision of the Income-tax Act, 1961.

(R) Amortisation of Expenditure in the case of Amalgamation/Demerger (Section 35DD)
The section provides that where an assessee, being an Indian company, incurs expenditure on or after April 1,
1999 wholly and exclusively for the purpose of amalgamation or demerger, the assessee shall be allowed a
deduction equal to one fifth of such expenditure for five successive previous years beginning with the previous
year in which amalgamation or demerger takes place. No deduction shall be allowed in respect of the above
expenditure under any other provisions of the Act.

228 EP-TL&P

(S) Amortisation of Expenditure in the case of Voluntary Retirement Scheme (Section 35DDA)
The object of this section is to provide amortisation of one-fifth every year from the year in which the expenditure
is incurred, of expenditure by way of payment of any sum to an employee in connection with his voluntary
retirement. It also provides that no deduction would be allowed in respect of such expenditure under any other
provision of the Act.
This provision supersedes the view expressed by the CBDT in its circular dated January 23, 2001, that the
expenditure has to be treated as capital expenditure with the result that no allowance would be permissible in
regard to this expenditure.

(T) Deduction in respect of Expenditure on Prospecting etc. for certain Minerals (Section 35E)
Section 35E of the Income-tax Act provides allowance to amortise the capital expenditure incurred by an assessee
towards prospecting for certain minerals. The benefit of amortisation under this section is available to Indian
companies and other non-corporate entities resident in India.
The expenditure qualifying for amortisation would cover expenses incurred by the assessee after 31-3-1970 in
relation to the operations towards prospecting for, or extraction or production of any of the 27 minerals or 16
groups of associated minerals specified in the Seventh Schedule to the Income-tax Act. The expenditure incurred
by the assessee would qualify for amortisation only if the expenditure in question is incurred by the assessee
during the year of commercial production and/or in one or more of the four years immediately preceding that
year; in any case the expenditure must have been incurred after 31-3-1970 wholly and exclusively on any of the
operations relating to the prospecting for any mineral or group of associated minerals or on the development of
a mine or other natural deposit of any such mineral or group of associated minerals. However, any portion of the
expenditure which is met directly or indirectly by any other person or authority and sale, salvage, compensation
or insurance moneys realised by the assessee in respect of any property or right brought into existence as a
result of the expenditure should be excluded from the amount of expenses qualifying for amortisation under this
section.
The assessee would not be entitled for amortisation under this section in respect of the following three items of
expenses namely,(i) Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of the site of the source of any mineral or group of associated
minerals or of any right in or over such site.
(ii) Expenditure on the acquisition of the deposits of such minerals or group of associated minerals or of
any right in or over such deposits; or
(iii) Expenditure of a capital nature in respect of any building, machinery, plant or furniture for which
depreciation allowance is available under Section 32 of the Income-tax Act.

(U) Other Deductions
In addition to the various items of expenses and allowances provided by
Sections 30 to 35E, Section 36 grants deduction in respect of the following items:
(i) Insurance Premium
(a) The assessee is entitled to the deduction of the amount of any premium paid in respect of insurance
against risk of damage or destruction of stocks or stores used for the purposes of the business or
profession.
(b) The amount of premium paid by federal milk co-operative society to effect or to keep in force an
insurance on the life of the cattle owned by a member of a co-operative society, being a primary
society engaged in supplying milk raised by its members to such federal milk co-operative society.

Lesson 4

Part III : Income From Business or Profession

229

(c) The amount of any premium paid by cheque by the assessee as an employer to effect or to keep in
force an insurance on the health of his employees under a scheme framed in this behalf by –
A. the General Insurance Corporation of India formed under Section 9 of the General Insurance
Business (Nationalisation) Act, 1972 and approved by the Central Government; or
B. any other insurer and approved by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority established
under Sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Act, 1999.
(ii) Bonus
Any amount paid by an employer to his employees as bonus or commission for services rendered
would be deductible. This deduction is allowable only in cases where the amount of bonus or commission
would not have otherwise been payable to the employees as profits or dividend if it had not been paid as
bonus or commission.
Where the bonus is paid during the previous year in respect of an earlier year in terms of an award
made during the previous year by the Industrial Tribunal, the deduction will be allowed during the previous
year in which the payment is made [Kalyana Mal Mills Ltd. v. C.I.T. (1965) 57 ITR p. 261].
Note that with effect from assessment year 1989-90 ceiling on bonus to be allowed as deduction is
proposed to be deleted. At the same time the bonus payment shall be covered by the provisions of
Section 43B so that they are allowed as deduction only on actual payment basis.
(iii) Interest on Borrowings
The amount of interest paid by a going concern in respect of capital borrowed for the purposes of
business or profession would be allowable as a deduction.
Provided that any amount of the interest paid, in respect of capital borrowed for acquisition of an asset
for extension of existing business or profession (whether capitalized in the books of account or not); for
any period beginning from the date on which the capital was borrowed for acquisition of the asset till the
date on which such asset was first put to use, shall not be allowed as deduction.
For the purposes of this allowance, recurring subscription paid periodically by shareholders or subscribers
in mutual benefit societies which fulfil such conditions as may be prescribed under the Income-tax
Rules would be deemed to be capital borrowed and consequently interest thereon would be allowable
as a deduction. The deduction allowable to the assessee in respect of interest on borrowings is not in
any way related to the application of the borrowed money for capital or revenue purposes. The only
conditions are that the borrowing must be genuine and the money borrowed must be utilized by the
assessee wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business. However, interest on capital contributed
or loan given by partners of a firm would not be allowable to the firm as deduction since the capital
contributed or loan given by the partners does not represent money borrowed by the firm. Similarly,
interest on share capital cannot be claimed by the shareholders or allowed to a company as a deduction
since share capital does not represent money borrowed by the company. However, interest on debentures
would be allowable as a deduction although the money borrowed by way of debentures might have
been utilized for investment in capital assets like buildings, machinery, plant or furniture or other assets.
However, if debenture loan is illusory and colourable, interest paid thereon is not allowable as a deduction.
Interest on capital borrowed for business, which is yet to be set up is not deductible. But interest on
capital borrowed for expansion of business is allowable as a deduction.
Where the assessee firm, carrying on the business of suppliers to Government Department, had to
borrow money for the purchase of Government Loan Bonds to obtain preference in securing orders for
supply and claimed deduction of interest on such borrowed money it was held that the interest so paid
was an admissible deduction under Section 36(1)(iii).

230 EP-TL&P
Interest on money borrowed by an assessee for the purpose of payment of income-tax would not be
allowable under this section since income-tax liability is a personal liability of the assessee and cannot
therefore, be treated as interest on money borrowed for the purposes of the business. Interest paid by
the assessee for delayed payment of advance tax is not also deductible under this section because it
does not represent interest on money borrowed.
(iiia) Discount on zero coupon bond
Any discount given by the assessee as an employer by way of pro rata amount of discount on a zero
coupon bond having regard to the period of life of such bond calculated in the manner prescribed would
be deductible as business expenditure.
(iv) Contributions to Recognised Provident Fund, Approved Superannuation Fund
Any sum paid by the assessee as an employer by way of contribution towards recognised provident
fund or an approved superannuation fund would be deductible in computing the business income of the
employer subject to section 43B. However, the contribution must be fixed on some definite basis by
reference to the income chargeable under the head ‘Salaries’. This deduction is subject to the limits and
conditions specified for this purpose under Income-tax Rules. According to Rule 88, the amount to be
allowed as a deduction on account of an initial contribution which an employer may make in respect of
the past services of an employee admitted to the benefits of a fund shall not exceed 25% of the employee’s
salary for each year of his past services with the employer as reduced by the employer’s contribution, if
any, to any provident fund (whether recognised or not) in respect of that employee for each year.
Where the company paid fixed salary plus commission at a fixed percentage of turnover achieved by
the employee and contributed to the recognised provident fund on the salary plus commission, it was
held to be allowable. [Gestetner Duplicators (P.) Ltd. v. C.I.T. (1979) 117 ITR p.1 (S.C.)].
(iva) Contribution towards pension scheme
Any sum paid by the assessee as an employer by way of contribution towards a pension scheme, as
referred to in section 80CCD, on account of an employee to the extent it does not exceed ten per cent
of the salary of the employee in the previous year.
Explanation. – For the purposes of this clause, “salary” includes dearness allowance, if the terms of
employment so provide, but excludes all other allowances and perquisites;
(v) Approved Gratuity Fund
Any sum paid by the assessee as an employer by way of contribution to an approved gratuity fund
created by him for the exclusive benefit of his employees under an irrevocable trust would be deductible
as business expenditure (subject to section 43B). In the case of contributions to gratuity fund, normally
the amount of contribution calculated on actuarial basis would be deductible although the liability to pay
gratuity to employees may arise at a future point of time as and when the employee retires or dies.
(va) Deposit of the Employee’s contribution by the Employer in relevant funds or or before date
Deduction is allowed to an assessee in respect of any sum received by him from any of his employees
to which the provisions of sub-clause (x) of clause 24 of Section 2 apply i.e., Contribution to any provident
fund, Superannuation fund, fund set-up under E.S.I. Act or any fund for welfare of employees, if such
sum is credited by the assessee to the employee’s account in the relevant fund or funds on or before the
due date. “Due date” for the purposes of this clause means the date by which the assessee is required,
as an employer to credit an employee’s contribution to the employee’s account in the relevant fund
under any Act, rule, order or notification issued thereunder or under any standing order, award, contract
of service or otherwise.

Lesson 4

Part III : Income From Business or Profession

231

Hence, the contributions received by an employer towards provident fund, an approved superannuation
fund or any fund under the ESI Act or any other fund are allowed to an assessee as deduction only if
such amount is “credited” by the employer to the employee’s account on or before the “due” date. The
employer cannot, therefore, claim any deduction in respect of such accounts without “crediting” the
employees’ account with the money. If the amount is not deposited in time then it will not be allowed as
deduction and employer’s share will be treated as income.
(vi) Animals
In respect of animals, which have been used for purposes of the business or profession of the assessee
otherwise than as stock-in-trade, a deduction would be allowable in the year in which the animals have
died or have become permanently useless for the purpose of the business. The amount of allowance
would be the difference between the actual cost of the animals to the assessee and the amount, if any,
realised in respect of the carcasses of the animal.
(vii) (a) Bad Debts [Section 36 (1)(vii) and (2)]
The amount of any debt or part thereof which is written off as irrecoverable in the accounts of the
assessee for the previous year is allowed to be deducted. The deduction for bad debt or part thereof
has been taken into account in computing the income of the assessee of the previous year in which the
amount of such debt or part thereof is written off or, of any earlier previous year, or, represents money
lent in the ordinary course of the business of banking or money-lending which is carried on by the
assessee. In this respect, the following conditions are pre-supposed:
1. Relationship of debtor and creditor
A bad debt pre-supposes the existence of a debt, and therefore, a relationship of debtor and creditor
is essential. Unless there is an admitted debt and it becomes irrecoverable, it cannot be written off
as a bad debt. C.I.T. v. Vanguard Insurance Co. Ltd. (1974) 97 ITR 546, 552 (Madras).
2. The debt must be incidental to the business or profession
The debt which is claimed as bad must be incidental to the business or profession carried on by the
assessee. If the debt is not incidental to the business or profession, such a debt cannot be deducted
as a bad debt. For example, in a solicitor’s profession, it is not a part of that profession to advance
money to clients who may require financial help to purchase properties, farms or stocks. It is immaterial
that the advance is made by a solicitor for the purposes of attracting clients and to induce them to
remain with him. Any loss arising from such a lending is not deductible. On the other hand, payment
of legal expenses of a law-suit under the client’s instruction is incidential to the profession. If any
amount remains unrecovered in respect of such expenses, it can be allowed as a bad debt against
the profits of the profession.
Similarly, where an assessee carries on business in an agricultural produce and has to advance
money to growers under an agreement to have the advances adjusted towards the price of the
produce to be delivered to the assessee, the losses incurred in the event of such advance becoming
irrecoverable, arise out of the business and can be deducted as bad debt C.I.T. v. Abdullakadar
(1961) 41 ITR 545, 551 (SC).
In the business of money-lending, each and every lending may not be in the ordinary course of
business. For example, where a money-lender invests his capital or accumulated profits in
government securities, mortgages and debentures and suffers a loss on the investment, such a
loss is capital loss and cannot be deducted as bad debt against the profits and gains of moneylending business. Sir Chinubhai Madhaval v. C.I.T. (1937) 5 ITR 210 (Bom.). Debts due from retiring
partners are capital sums and the loss of such amounts cannot be written off and claimed as bad
debts. Girdhari Lal Gian Chand v. C.I.T. (1971) 79 ITR 561 (All.).

232 EP-TL&P
3. Deduction in the year of writing off
No such deduction shall be allowed unless such debt or part thereof has been taken into account in
computing the income of the assessee for the previous year in which the amount of such debt or
part thereof is written off or of an earlier previous year, or represents money lent in the ordinary
course of the business of banking or money-lending which is carried on by the assessee. The age
of a debt is no doubt a relevant factor to be taken into consideration, but a time-barred debt is not
necessarily bad: neither is a debt which is not time-barred necessarily good. BCGA (Punjab) Ltd. v.
C.I.T. (1937) 5 ITR 279. A debt may have become time-barred but an assessee may not opt to claim
it as bad if he relies on the honesty and integrity of the debtor. On the other hand, a debt may
become bad even if it may not be time-barred. It is not necessary that a debt can be claimed as bad
only if an assessee has failed to recover it through a court of law. Legal unenforceability of the claim
does not prevent the amount from being a bad and irrecoverable debt for the purposes of taxation.
Badrinarayan Balkrishan v. C.I.T. (1968) 69 ITR 323 (A.P.). Taking into account the precarious and
shaky financial position of the debtor, a creditor may opt not to institute legal proceedings and waste
his good money after bad money. The assessee must satisfy the Assessing Officer that in fact the
debt or the loan has become irrecoverable in the accounting year in which a claim for deduction is
made in respect thereof and it has been written off from the book.
4. Adjustment in the year of recovery
The deduction in respect of a bad debt is based on a mere estimate. Therefore, if the amount of final
recovery and the amount allowed as bad debt in respect of a bad debt falls short of the amount of
such debt, such deficiency is further deductible in the year of final recovery. For example, an assessee
claims a debt of ` 25,000 as bad in 1987-88. The Assessing Officer accepted a claim of ` 12,000
only. As a final settlement, the assessee recovered ` 8,000 in 1989-90 in respect of such debt. The
amount of final recovery (` 12,000 + ` 8,000) falls short of the amount of the debt (i.e. ` 25,000).
Such deficiency of ` 5,000 is deductible in the year in which the assessee writes it off in his books
of account.
Conversely, if the amount of final recovery and the amount allowed as bad debt in respect of a debt
exceed the amount of such debt, such excess is chargeable profit of the previous year in which
such recovery is made [Section 41(4)]. It is immaterial whether the business or profession is in
existence in such year or not. Continuing with the above example, if the amount of final recovery is
` 16,000, there is a taxable profit of ` 3,000 (` 16,000 + ` 12,000 - ` 25,000).
Note that recovery of bad debts is chargeable to tax as deemed profit [under Section 41(4)] if the
recovery is made by the same person who got the allowance of the deduction. If the two entities are
different the recovery of bad debt is not chargeable to tax [under Section 41(4)]. For example, a firm
got the allowance of deduction in respect of bad debts. Subsequently, the firm is dissolved and it is
taken over by one of the partners who recovers a part of the bad debt earlier allowed in the assessment
of the firm. The partner is not assessable in respect of such recovery. C.I.T. v. P.K. Kaimil (1980) 123
IRE 755 (Madras).
5. No allowance for bad debts of a discontinued business
No deduction is allowed for a bad debt of a business which has been discontinued before the
commencement of the accounting year. Such a bad debt cannot be deducted from the profits of a
separate existing business. Kameshwar Singh v. C.I.T. (1947) 15 ITR 248. An assessee can claim
the deduction for a bad debt of a business which is carried on by the assessee for at least sometime
during the previous year. It is not necessary that the business should be carried on throughout the
previous year.
6. Successor not entitled to write off predecessor’s debts
The deduction of a bad debt can be claimed if the debt had been taken into account in computing

Lesson 4

Part III : Income From Business or Profession

233

the income of the assessee of that previous year or an earlier previous year unless it represents
money lent in the ordinary course of the business of banking or money-lending which is carried on
by the assessee. Therefore, the debts of a predecessor-in-business may not be deductible in the
hands of a successor-in-business. Thus, where the entire business of a partnership, after retirement
of one of the partners, was taken over by the other partner who continued with the same stock-intrade, he is not entitled to claim a debt of the partnership as bad if the same is not realised. However,
in certain cases even a successor is entitled to write off predecessor’s debts. On dissolution of the
firm, if one of the partners takes over the business with all assets and liabilities and carries it on as
successor, he is entitled to allowance when a debt originally due to firm becomes bad. It is merely
an incident flowing from the transfer of the business together with its assets and liabilities, from the
previous owner to the transferee. It is a right which should, on a proper appreciation of all that is
implied in a transfer of a business be regarded as belonging to the new owner. (CIT v. T. Veerabhadra
Rao, K. Koteswara Rao & Company (1985) 155 ITR 152 (SC).
If business is carried on without any break, change merely occurring in persons carrying on business
would not disentitle business to claim deduction under this Section [E.A.V. Krishnamurty & Son v.
CIT (1985) 152 ITR 640 (Mad.)].
7. No Deduction for provision for bad & doubtful debt:
Any bad debt or part thereof written off as irrecoverable in the accounts of the assessee shall not
include any provision for bad and doubtful debts made in the accounts of the assessee. [Explanation
2 to section 36(1)(vii)]
(vii) (b) Provisions for bad and doubtful debts in case of Scheduled or non-scheduled Banks [Section
36(1)(vii) and (viia)]
A scheduled bank or non-scheduled bank in India is allowed deduction in respect of provision made for bad and
doubtful debts in accordance with the following provisions :
(i) Bank having no branch is rural area : The bank which have no branch in rural area shall be allowed
deduction in respect of provision for bad and doubtful debts as follows :
– provision made for bad and doubtful debts
– 7.5% of gross total income
whichever is lower.
(ii) Bank having branch in rural area :
The following amount is allowed as deduction :
(a) provision made for bad and doubtful debts or
(b) (i) 7.5% of gross total income and
(ii) 10% of the aggregate average advances made by the rural branch whichever is less
Average advances qualifying for the deduction will be computed in the following manner as per Rule 6ABA:
(a) The amount of advances made by each rural branch as outstanding at the end of the last day of each
month comprised in the previous year is to be aggregated separately.
(b) The sum so arrived in case of each branch is to be divided by the number of months for which the
outstanding advances have been taken into account for the purose of clause (a).

DEDUCTION IN RESPECT OF PROVISION FOR BAD AND DOUBTFUL DEBTS IN CASE OF
NBFCS
Under the existing provisions of sub-clause (c) of clause (viia) of sub-section (1) of section 36 of the Act, in
computing the profits of a public financial institutions, State financial corporations and State industrial investment

234 EP-TL&P
corporations a deduction, limited to an amount not exceeding five per cent of the gross total income, computed,
before making any deduction under the aforesaid clause and Chapter VI-A, is allowed in respect of any provision
for bad and doubtful debt.
The above clause has been amended to provide deduction from total income, provision for bad and doubtful debts
to the extent of 5% of total income in case of NBFCs also as was available earlier to PFIs, SFCs and SIICOs only.
This amendment effective from 1st April, 2017 and accordingly apply in relation to assessment year
2017-18 and subsequent assessment years.
(viii) Special reserves created by Financial Corporations
Special reserve created by financial corporation engaged in providing long-term finance for industrial or
agricultural development in India or development of infrastructure in India or by a public company formed
and registered in India with the main object of carrying on the business of providing long-term finance
for construction or purchase of houses in India for residential purpose, is deductible to the extent of 40%
of income from such activity.
Condition to be fulfilled to get the above deduction:
(i) The aggregate of the amounts carried to such reserve account from time to time do not exceed twice
the amount of the paid-up share capital of the corporation, or the company and its general reserves.
In this clause –
(a) “financial corporation” shall include a public company and a government company;
(b) “public company” shall have the meaning assigned to it in Section 3 of the Companies Act, 1956; and
(c) “government company” shall have the meaning assigned to it in Section 617 of the Companies Act,
1956.
In terms of Section 41(4A) any withdrawal from such special reserve would be deemed to be the profits
and gains of business even if the business is closed down.
(ix) Expenditure on Family Planning
In the case of companies any bona fide expenditure incurred for the purpose of promoting family
planning amongst the employees would be deductible. In cases where the expenditure is wholly or
partly in the nature of a capital expenditure, the deduction allowable to the company in respect of the
capital expenditure would be a sum equal to 1/5th in each year of the expenditure in respect of the
accounting year in which it was actually incurred and 1/5th of each of the subsequent four years
immediately following that year. The unabsorbed part of the capital expenditure on family planning
incurred by the companies would be treated in the same way as unabsorbed capital expenditure on
scientific research or unabsorbed depreciation and could be carried forward indefinitely without any
time limit in cases where the profits of the assessee are not sufficient to cover the amount as allowable.
(x) Expenditure incurred by Corporation or a Body Corporate
Any expenditure which is not being in the nature of capital expenditure incurred by a corporation or a
body corporate, by whatever name called, constituted or established by a Central, State or Provincial
Act, is notified by the Central Government in the official Gazette and the expenditure incurred for the
objects and purposes authorised by the Act under which such corporation or body corporate was
constituted or established, is deductible.
(xi) Banking Cash Transaction Tax
Any amount of Banking Cash Transaction Tax paid by the assessee during the previous year on the
taxable banking transactions entered into by him are allowed as deduction.

Lesson 4

Part III : Income From Business or Profession

235

“Banking Cash Transaction Tax” and “Taxable Banking Transaction” shall have the same meanings
respectively assigned to them under Chapter VII of the Finance Act, 2005;
(xii) Any sum paid by a public financial institution by way of contribution to notified Credit Guarantee Fund
Trust for small industries is allowed as deduction.
(xiii) Securities Transaction Tax
An amount equal to the securities transaction tax paid by the assessee in respect of the taxable securities
transactions entered into in the course of his business during the previous year, if the income arising
from such taxable securities transactions is included in the income computed under the head “Profits
and gains of business or profession is allowed as deduction.
“Securities Transaction Tax” and “Taxable Securities Transaction” shall have the meanings respectively
assigned to them under Chapter VII of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2004 (23 of 2004);
(xiv) Commodities Transaction Tax
An amount equal to the Commodities Transaction Tax paid by the assessee in respect of the taxable
commodities transactions entered into in the course of his business during the previous year, if the
income arising from such taxable commodities transactions is included in the income computed under
the head “Profits and gains of business or profession” is allowed as deduction.

(V) Other Expenses not covered by the Previous Deductions
Section 37(1) of the Income-tax Act provides for allowance in respect of any other item of expenditure not
covered by any of the provisions contained in Sections 30 to 36 discussed above. This deduction is subject to
the following conditions:
(i) The expenditure must have been laid out or expended by the assessee wholly and exclusively for the
purposes of his business or profession.
(ii) The expenditure should not be in the nature of a capital expenditure.
(iii) The expenditure should not represent any item of personal expenditure of the assessee.
(iv) The deduction claimed should not cover any of the items of the expenditure which are specifically
disallowed under the Act.
For the purposes of section 37(1), any expenditure incurred by an assessee on the activities relating to corporate
social responsibility referred to in section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 shall not be deemed to have been incurred
for the purpose of business and hence shall not be allowed as deduction under section 37 of Income-tax Act.
However, the Corporate Social Responsibility expenditure which is of the nature described in section 30 to
section 36 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 shall be allowed deduction under those sections subject to fulfillment of
conditions, specified therein.

Points for Consideration for Allowance of Expenditure as Deduction
– For the purpose of allowance of expenses under this section, it is not essential that the expenditure in
question must necessarily have resulted in the earning of income or profits by the assessee.
– It is enough if the expenditure is incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business although
it is not necessary for the assessee to prove that the expenditure is unavoidable or that the expenditure has
been incurred out of business necessity.
– The assessee would be entitled to the allowance if he could prove that the expenditure is justified and has
been incurred by reason of commercial expediency. Whether the particular expenditure is incurred in compliance
with some other law for the time being in force or not the assessee would still be entitled to the deduction.

236 EP-TL&P
– Capital expenditure has been specifically disallowed by the provisions, care must be taken to ensure that a
proper distinction is made between expenses of a capital nature and those of revenue nature because only
revenue expenses would qualify for allowance under this section. The broad test is to determine whether
the expenditure has resulted in the acquisition of a capital asset or property. To put it in other words, whether
such expenditure has resulted in giving to the assessee a benefit of an enduring nature. The expression
“enduring” used in this context should not be mistaken to mean ever-lasting or eternal nature but if the
benefit of an expenditure is so transitory or ephemeral as to be not in existence for some period the expenditure
in question must be treated as being of a revenue nature.
– Care should also be taken to distinguish between expenses incurred for the purpose of the business to earn
income and payments which are alleged to be expenses which, however, are really in the nature of diversion
of profits.
– The allowability or otherwise of an item of expenditure under this section would be a question of facts and law and
the ultimate conclusion would be the decision of the High Court of the Supreme Court, as the case may be.
For a detailed study of the various items of expenses which are allowable or disallowable under this
section, students may refer suggested readings.
An explanation has been added by Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998 to clarify that any expenditure incurred by an
assessee for any purpose which is an offence or which is prohibited by Law shall not be allowed.

Some of the examples of allowable expenses under Section 37(1) are:
(i) Expenditure incurred on raising loans or issuing debentures but not on issuing share capital.
(ii) Legal expenses incurred:
(a) to avoid a business liability, e.g. for alleged breach of a trading contract;
(b) to defend the assessee’s title to his assets, e.g. land, building, etc.;
(c) to secure the termination of a disadvantageous trading relationship, e.g. removal of an undesirable
employee;
(d) by a director of a company in defending a suit brought to challenge the validity of his election to the
directorship;
(e) to protect the capital asset of the business which has already been acquired;
(f) by a company in resisting a winding up petition by some shareholders;
(g) for defending monopoly rights;
(h) incurred in restraining another company from using assessee’s trade mark.
However, the expenses incurred in criminal proceedings are not allowable. Legal expenses relating to
acquisition of capital asset for a business are capital expenses and as such, not allowable.
In this connection the Supreme Court held that-where litigation expenses are incurred by the assessee
for the purpose of creating, curing or completing his title to the capital, then the expenses incurred must
be considered as capital expenditure. But if the litigation expenses are incurred to protect the business
of the assessee, they must be considered as a revenue expenditure. [Dalmia Jain & Co. v. C.I.T. (1971)
81 ITR p. 754 (S.C.)].
Expenditure for prosecuting civil proceedings is deductible provided the expenditure was laid out for the
purpose of the business wholly and exclusively i.e. to promote the interest of the business. [Sree
Meenakshi Mills v. C.I.T. (1976) 63 ITR, p. 207 (S.C.)]
(iii) Bonus to employees under an industrial award.
(iv) Expenses for the installation of new telephone.

Lesson 4

Part III : Income From Business or Profession

237

(v) Sales tax is an admissible deduction but not estate duty.
(vi) Interest on unpaid purchase price of goods or capital assets.
(vii) Expenditure incurred to oppose nationalization or to prevent extinction of business. However, the donations
given for the political parties or for political cause are not admissible deductions under Section 37.
(viii) Subscriptions given are allowed if their payment is compulsory or commercially expedient and of benefit
to the payer.
(ix) Expenses incurred on the occasion of festival or customary days are allowed up to a reasonable amount
keeping in view the size of the business and subject to the satisfaction of the Assessing Officer that the
expenses are not expenses of personal, social or religions nature.
(x) Recurring expenses incurred on imparting basic training to apprentices under the Apprentices Act, 1961
is deductible.
(xi) Initial expenditure on the first installation of fluorescent tube lights is treated as Capital expenditure and
hence not deductible but all subsequent expenditure for replacement of tubes is treated as revenue

an assessee in any souvenir, tract, pamphlet or the like published by a political party.
Certain Allowable Losses
Losses which are directly incidental to the business or profession of the assessee are allowable. Following are
some examples of such losses:
(1) Robbery or Dacoity: Loss caused by robbery or dacoity is not deductible. But, if it is incidental to
business it will be allowed as a deduction and this depends upon the specific circumstances and
conditions. For example, if cash is sent for disbursement at different centers by a sugar factory in
rural area, it is incidental to business and is, therefore, allowed. Any loss due to robbery in a bank will
be allowed as the bank is under an obligation to maintain some cash outside the storeroom for
payments.
(2) Embezzlement, Theft, etc.: The loss of money due to embezzlement by an employee handling the
funds of the business while discharging his official duties is allowed as deduction. It is deductible
when discovered. When an employee goes to bank to deposit the cash or takes cash with him f
or disbursement and he takes away the money for his own use, even then, the loss is allowable.
Theft by a cashier, who is incharge of cash is also an allowable loss. A theft committed either by an
employee or by someone else by breaking open into the business premises after office hours, is also
allowable.
(3) Loss due to Non-recovery of advances: If it is the practice in a business to give advance money to
the suppliers and if the supplier neither supplies the order nor refunds the advance money, the loss
sustained by the assessee is incidental to business and is, therefore, allowable.

TAXATION OF INCOME FROM 'PATENTS’
In order to encourage indigenous research & development activities and to make India a global R & D hub,
the Government has decided to put in place a concessional taxation regime for income from patents. The aim
of the concessional taxation regime is to provide an additional incentive for companies to retain and
commercialise existing patents and to develop new innovative patented products. This will encourage
companies to locate the high-value jobs associated with the development, manufacture and exploitation of
patents in India. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has recommended,
in Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project under Action Plan 5, the nexus approach which prescribes
that income arising from exploitation of Intellectual property (IP) should be attributed and taxed in the jurisdiction
where substantial research & development (R&D) activities are undertaken rather than the jurisdiction of legal
ownership only.
Accordingly, new section 115BBF has been inserted to provide that where the total income of the eligible assessee
includes any income by way of royalty in respect of a patent developed and registered in India, then such royalty
shall be taxable at the rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on the gross amount of royalty. No
expenditure or allowance in respect of such royalty income shall be allowed under the Act.
For the purpose of this concessional tax regime an eligible assessee means a person resident in India, who is
the true and first inventor of the invention and whose name is entered on the patent register as the patentee in
accordance with Patents Act, 1970 and includes evey such person, being the true and the first inventor of the
invention, where more than one person is registered as pententee under Patents Act, 1970 in respect of that
patent.
The eligible assessee may exercise the option for taxation of income by way of royalty in respect of a patent
developed and registered in India in accordance with the provisions of this section, in the prescribed manner, on

Lesson 4

Part III : Income From Business or Profession

239

or before the due date specified under sub-section (1) of section 139 for furnishing the return of income for the
relevant previous year.
Where an eligible assessee opts for taxation of income by way of royalty in respect of a patent developed and
registered in India for any previous year in accordance with the provisions of this section and the assessee
offers the income for taxation for any of the five assessment years relevant to the previous year succeeding the
previous year not in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (1), then, the assessee shall not be eligible to
claim the benefit of the provisions of this section for five assessment years subsequent to the assessment year
relevant to the previous year in which such income has not been offered to tax in accordance with the provisions
of sub-section (1).
These amendments effective from 1st April, 2017 and, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment
year 2017-18 and subsequent years.

EXEMPTION IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN ACTIVITY RELATED TO DIAMOND TRADING IN
"SPECIAL NOTIFIED ZONE”
The existing provisions of section 5 of the Act provides for the scope of total income. In the case of a nonresident, the taxation of income takes place only if the income accrues or arises in India or is deemed to
accrue or arise in India or is received in India. Section 9 of the Act provides for circumstances in which the
income is deemed to accrue or arise in India. One of the circumstances providing for income to be deemed to
accrue or arise in India is if any income is directly or indirectly derived through or from a business connection
in India.
In order to facilitate the FMCs to undertake activity of display of uncut diamond (without any sorting or sale) in
the special notified zone, the provision of Section 9 of the Act has been amended to provide that in case of a
foreign company engaged in the business of mining of diamonds, no income shall be deemed to accrue or arise
in India to it through or from the activities which are confined to display of uncut and unassorted diamonds in a
Special Zone notified by the Central Government in the Official Gazette in this behalf.
This amendment effective retrospectively from 1st April, 2016 and accordingly apply in relation to
Assessment Year 2016-17 and subsequent assessment years.

TAX INCENTIVES FOR START-UPS
With a view to providing an impetus to start-ups and facilitate their growth in the initial phase of their business, it
is provided that a deduction of one hundred percent of the profits and gains derived by an eligible start-up from
a business involving innovation development, deployment or commercialization of new products, processes or
services driven by technology or intellectual property.
The benefit of 100% deductions of the profits derived from such business shall be available to an eligible startup which is setup before 01.04.2019. Keeping this objective in view, a new Section 54EE has been inserted that
provide exemption from capital gains tax if the long term capital gains proceeds are invested by an assessee in
units of such specified fund, as may be notified by the Central Government in this behalf, subject to the condition
that the amount remains invested for three years failing which the exemption shall be withdrawn. The investment
in the units of the specified fund shall be allowed up to Rs. 50 lakh.
The existing provisions of section 54GB provide exemption from tax on long term capital gains in respect of the
gains arising on account of transfer of a residential property, if such capital gains are invested in subscription of
shares of a company which qualifies to be a small or medium enterprise under the Micro, Small and Medium
Enterprises Act, 2006 subject to other conditions specified therein.
With an objective to provide relief to an individual or HUF willing to setup a start-up company by selling a

240 EP-TL&P
residential property to invest in the shares of such company, an amendment has been made in section 54GB so
as to provide that long term capital gains arising on account of transfer of a residential property shall not be
charged to tax if such capital gains are invested in subscription of shares of a company which qualifies to be an
eligible start-up subject to the condition that the individual or HUF holds more than fifty per cent shares of the
company and such company utilises the amount invested in shares to purchase new asset before due date of
filing of return by the investor.
The existing provision of section 54GB requires that the company should invest the proceeds in the purchase of
new asset being new plant and machinery but does not include, inter-alia, computers or computer software.
With a view to avoid the incidence of the aforesaid condition on start-ups where computers or computer software
form the core asset base owing to nature of business activity, it is provided that the expression "new asset"
includes computers or computer software in case of technology driven start-ups so certified by the Inter-Ministerial
Board of Certification notified by the Central Government in the official Gazette.
These amendments effective from 1st April, 2017 and, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment
year 2017-18 and subsequent assessment years.

for the welfare of the employees of the assessee out of the sum referred above, the amount of such
expenditure shall, in case no deduction has been allowed to the assessee in respect of such sum, be
deducted in computing the business income of the assessee of the previous year in which such expenditure
is so laid out or expended. It is also provided that where the assessee has before March 1, 1984, paid any
sum to any fund, trust, company, association of persons, body of individuals, society or other institutions,
then notwithstanding anything contained in any other law or in any instrument, he would be entitled:
(a) to claim the unutilised amount be repaid to him and where any claim is so made, the unutilised amount
shall be repaid, as soon as may be, to him; and
(b) to claim that land, building, machinery, plant and furniture acquired or constructed by the fund, trust,
company, association of persons, body of individuals, society or other institution out of the sum paid by
the assessee, be transferred to him and where any claim is so made, such asset shall be transferred, as
soon as may be to him.

The aforesaid provisions took effect retrospectively from 1st April, 1980, and accordingly, apply in relation to
the assessment year 1980-81 and subsequent years.

(c) Disallowance of unpaid statutory liability (Section 43B)
Under the income-tax law, a person carrying on a business or profession can account for his income either on
cash or mercantile basis. The latter, however, have to reckon with the restrictions contained in Section 43B. This
section cuts into the freedom of a business to claim certain specified expenses on due basis. The section has
broadly divided the targeted expenses into two i.e., according to section 43B even if an assessee maintains
books on mercantile system then he will be allowed exemption of the following expenses only on payment basis.
In the first category are:
(a) taxes, duties, cess or fees payable under any law;
(b) bonus and commission to employees;
(c) interest to public financial institutions, state financial corporations, state industrial investment corporations
and to scheduled banks in respect of term loans or advances;
(d) leave encashment.
(e) any sum payable by employer by way of contribution to provident fund or super annuation fund or any
other fund for welfare of employees.
(f) Expenditure pertaining to use of railways assets.
Extension of scope of section 43B to include certain payments made to Railways
The existing provisions of section 43B of the Act, inter alia, provide that any sum payable by the assessee by
way of tax, cess, duty or fee, employer contribution to Provident Fund, etc., is allowable as deduction of the
previous year in which the liability to pay such sum was incurred (relevant previous year) if the same is actually
paid on or before the due date of furnishing of the return of income irrespective of method of accounting followed
by a person.
In order to ensure prompt payment of dues to railways, clause (g) in Section 43B has been inserted to provide
that any sum payable by the assessee to the Indian Railways for use of railway assets shall be allowed as
deduction only, if it is actually paid on or before the due date of furnishing the return of income of the relevant
previous year.
These four sets of expenses outstanding at the end of the previous year would be allowed as deduction only to
the extent they have been actually paid on or before the due date of filing the income-tax return failing which
they would be allowed in the previous year they have been actually paid. Where interest as stipulated in (d)
above is converted into a loan, borrowing or advance and is not paid, interest so converted will not be treated as
having been actually paid, and accordingly, will not be allowed as a deduction from business income.
The second category deals with employers’ contribution to provident fund superannuation fund, gratuity fund or
any other fund for the welfare of employees. No deduction on this account shall be allowed unless payment is
made to the appropriate authority like the Provident Commissioner in case of PF contribution on or before the
due date set out in the relevant statute like the PF Act. In case the payment was made otherwise than by cash,
the sum should have been realised within 15 days of such due date. For example, if PF contributions are to be
handed over to the relevant authority within a month from the end of the month in which it was deducted from
employees’ salary and the employer for the month of August ‘99 deductions makes the payment say in the
month of October ‘99, he will lose the benefit of deduction in so far as contributions to PF for the month of August
‘99 are concerned.
However, Finance Act, 2003 has omitted the second proviso and therefore PF and ESI contribution will be
allowed as deduction even if they are not paid within due date specified under relevant Acts.

248 EP-TL&P

DEEMED PROFITS
Section 41 of the Income-tax Act enumerates items of notional income which are deemed to be income from
business or profession chargeable to tax. The liability to tax in respect of deemed profits would arise not only
during the existence of the business but also after its discontinuance. The items of deemed profits are enlisted
below:
(i) Remission of Liability or Recoupment of Loss or Expenditure: Where any allowance or deduction
has been made in the assessment for any year in respect of losses, expenditure or trading liability
incurred by the assessee and subsequently the assessee or his/its successor in business has obtained,
whether in cash or in any other manner whatsoever, any amount in respect of such loss or expenditure
or some benefit in respect of such trading liability by way of remission or cessation thereof during any
subsequent accounting year, the amount so obtained or the value of the benefit so accruing to the
assessee or his/its successor in business as the case may be, must be deemed to be the profits and
gains of business or profession and must be charged to tax as the income of the assessee or his/its
successor in business as the case may be for the year in which the remission or cessation takes place.
This tax liability would arise irrespective of the fact whether the business or profession in respect of
which the allowance or deduction has been made is being continued to be carried on by the assessee
in the year of remission of liability or not. For instance, if sales tax is paid by the assessee in the year
1998-99 and the assessee gets a refund of sales-tax previously paid in the year 1999-2000, the refund
would be taxable as the assessee’s income of 1999-2000. But the taxability of any deemed profit on
account of remission of liability or recoupment of loss would arise only if the liability in question or the
amount of the loss was previously allowed as a deduction in computing the business income of the
assessee. For instance, if the income-tax assessment for the year in which the expenditure or loss was
claimed was made exparte or was a best judgement assessment and the income was estimated, it
cannot be said that the expenditure was actually allowed as a deduction in the assessment. Consequently,
if there is a remission of the liability subsequently, the assessee cannot be brought to charge in respect
of the same. The Finance (No. 2) Act, 1996 has clarified that unilateral write back of any liability would
be taxable as deemed income.
“Successor in business” means –
(i) in case of amalgamation of companies the amalgamated company;
(ii) where the first mentioned person is succeeded by any other person in that business or
profession, the other person;
(iii) where a firm carrying on business or profession is succeeded by another firm, the other firm;
(iv) where there has been a demerger, the resulting company.
(ii) Where any building, machinery plant or furniture owned by the assessee and used for the purpose
of business for which depreciation under Section 32(1)(i) is claimed, is sold, discarded, demolished or
destroyed and the money payable together with scrap value in respect of such assets exceeds the
written down value, the excess to the extent of difference between the actual cost and the written down
value shall be taxable as business income in the previous year in which the moneys payable become
due.
Even if in the year the moneys payable becomes due, the business for which these assets were used is
no longer in existence, the provisions of this section shall apply as if the business is in existence in that
previous year.
(iii) Capital expenditure on Scientific Research: Where an assessee incurs capital expenditure on scientific
research, the entire amount of such expenditure is allowable as a deduction in computing the business

Lesson 4

Part III : Income From Business or Profession

249

income of the assessee in the same year in which the expenditure is incurred. If subsequent to the
incurring of the expenditure, the asset representing the capital expenditure is sold, without having been
used for other purposes, the assessee would be liable to pay tax on the excess of sale proceeds
together with the deduction allowed earlier over the amount of capital expenditure or the amount of
deduction allowed earlier whichever is less.
Further, the assessee is liable to pay tax on the balancing charge even if the assessee’s business is not
in existence during the previous year in which the money payable in respect of any asset becomes due.
Explanation: For the purpose of Sub-section (3) –
(1) “moneys payable in respect of any building, machinery, plant or furniture” includes (a) any insurance, salvage or compensation moneys payable in respect thereof;
(b) where the building, machinery, plant or furniture is sold, the price for which it is sold,
so however, that where the actual cost of a motor car is, in accordance with the proviso to clause (1)
of Section 43, taken to be twenty-five thousand rupees, the moneys payable in respect of such
motor car shall be taken to be a sum which bears to the amount for which the motor car is sold or,
as the case may be, the amount of any insurance, salvage or compensation moneys payable in
respect thereof (including the amount of scrap value, if any) the same proportion as the amount of
twenty-five thousand rupees bears to the actual cost of the motor car to the assessee as it would
have been computed before applying the said proviso;
(2) “sold” includes a transfer by way of exchange or a compulsory acquisition under any law for the time
being in force but does not include a transfer, in a scheme of amalgamation, of any asset by the
amalgamating company to the amalgamated company where the amalgamated company is an
Indian Company.
(iv) Recovery of Bad Debts: Where the assessee claims a deduction in any year in respect of a debt which
has become bad or irrecoverable and the Assessing Officer allows a deduction to the extent of the bad
debts, if subsequently the assessee recovers either the full amount of the debt which was previously
written off as bad or part thereof, the amount so recovered would be chargeable to tax as the business
income of the assessee in the year of recovery. But if the amount claimed by the assessee as bad debt
was previously disallowed by the Assessing Officer on the ground that it had not actually become bad or
it was not written off by the assessee, when the money is recovered, there would be no liability to tax in
respect thereof. In cases where the Assessing Officer had allowed only a part thereof as bad, in the
subsequent year of recovery, the tax liability under this section must be on the amount of difference
between the amount recovered and the bad debt disallowed by the Assessing Officer.
(v) Withdrawal of any amount from special reserve: Where a deduction has been allowed in respect of
any special reserve created and maintained under clauses (viii) of Sub-section (1) of Section 36 any
amount subsequently withdrawn from such special reserve shall be deemed to be the profits and gains
of business or profession and accordingly be chargeable to income tax as the income of the previous
year in which such amount is withdrawn.
Where any amount is withdrawn from the special reserve in a previous year in which the business is no
longer in existence, the provisions of this sub-section shall apply as if the business is in existence in that
previous year.
(vi) Set off of Losses of a Defunct Business against Deemed Profit: Where the business or profession
referred to in this section is no longer in existence and there is income chargeable to tax under points (i),
(ii), (iv) and (v) given above in respect of that business or profession, any loss, not being a loss sustained
in speculation business, which arose in that business or profession during the previous year in which it

250 EP-TL&P
ceased to exist and which could not be set off against any other income of that previous year shall as far
as may be, be set off against the income chargeable to tax under the sub-section aforesaid.

SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR DEDUCTION
SPECIAL PROVISION FOR DEDUCTIONS IN THE CASE OF BUSINESS FOR PROSPECTING
ETC. FOR MINERAL OIL (SECTION 42)
For the purpose of computing the profits and gains of any business of prospecting for or the extraction or
production of mineral oils in relation to which the Central Government has entered into an agreement with any
person for the association or participation in such business of the Central Government, the assessee is entitled
to an allowance over and above the various items of allowances and deductions permissible under the Incometax Act. The additional allowance in this regard would be in relation to the expenditure incurred by the assessee
by way of infructuous or abortive exploration expenses in respect of any area surrendered prior to the beginning
of commercial production by the assessee. Where the expenditure is incurred after the beginning of commercial
production, the special allowance would relate to the expenditure incurred by the assessee, whether before or
after such commercial production, in respect of drilling or exploration activities or services or in respect of
physical assets used in that connection [except those assets which qualify for depreciation allowance under
Section 32 only in those cases where the agreement is entered into before 31st Day of March, 1981]. Further,
expenditure incurred in relation to the depletion of mineral oil in the mining area in respect of assessment year
relevant to the accounting year in which commercial production is begun and such succeeding year as may be
specified in the agreement between the Central Government and the assessee would also qualify for this
allowance. The amount of this special allowance must be computed in the manner specified in the agreement
and wherever necessary the other provisions of the Income-tax Act would, for this purpose, be deemed to have
been modified to the extent necessary for giving effect to the terms of the agreement. For the purposes of this
section, ‘mineral oil’, includes petroleum and natural gas.
Section 42 has been amended, with effect from the assessment year 1999-2000 to provide that subject to the
provisions of the agreement entered into by the Central Government, where the business of assessee consisting
of the prospecting for or extraction or production of petroleum and natural gas is transferred or any interest
therein is transferred, wholly or partly, and the proceeds of the transfer are less than the expenditure incurred
remaining unallowed, a deduction equal to the expenditure remaining unallowed as reduced by the proceeds of
transfer, shall be allowed in respect of the previous year, in which the business or an interest therein has been
transferred. Where such business or any interest therein is transferred and proceeds of the transfer exceed the
amount of expenditure incurred remaining unallowed, the excess amount shall be chargeable to tax as profits
and gains of business in the previous year in which such business or interest therein has been transferred. No
deduction shall be allowed in the previous year in which the business or any interest therein is transferred in
case the proceeds of transfer are not less than the expenditure remaining unallowed.
Where in a scheme of amalgamation or demerger, the amalgamating or the demerged company sells or otherwise
transfers the business to the amalgamated or the resulting company (being an Indian company) the provisions
of this sub-section shall not apply to amalgamating or demerged company. Instead they will apply to the
amalgamated or the resulting company as they would have applied to the amalgamating or the demerged
company if the latter had not transferred the business or interest in the business.

SPECIAL PROVISIONS CONSEQUENTIAL TO THE CHANGES IN THE RATE OF EXCHANGE OF
CURRENCY [Section 43A]
Section 43A of the Income-tax Act contains special provisions to provide for additional allowance to the assessee
in respect of capital assets whose actual cost is affected by the changes in the rate of exchange of currency.
These provisions are to be taken into account in all cases where an assessee has acquired any depreciable
asset from any country outside India for the purposes of his business or profession and as a result of a change

Lesson 4

Part III : Income From Business or Profession

251

in the rate of exchange at any time subsequent to the date of its acquisition by the assessee, there is an
increase or reduction in the liability of the assessee in terms of Indian Rupees for making payment towards the
whole or part of the cost of the asset or for payment of the whole or part of the moneys borrowed by him from any
person directly or indirectly in any foreign currency specifically for the purpose of acquiring the capital asset. The
amount by which the liability of the assessee in terms of Indian Rupees is increased or reduced as a result of
change in the rate of exchange of the currency, would be added to or as the case may be deducted from the
actual cost of the asset as defined in Section 43(1). Consequently, the amounts of depreciation allowable to
assessee in respect of the asset would correspondingly be increased or reduced, as the case may be. This
provision for changes in the rate of exchange of currency resulting in the increase or reduction in the deduction
allowable in respect of actual cost of the asset would apply in respect of capital expenditure on scientific research,
capital expenditure incurred for acquisition of patents and copyrights, capital expenditure incurred by companies
for promoting family planning amongst their employees and capital expenditure incurred for acquiring a capital
asset, the cost of which under Section 48 has to be ascertained for the purpose of determining the amount of
capital gains. The assessee would not, however, be entitled to any increase or reduction in the amount of
development rebate allowed or allowable to him on the basis of the revised actual cost of the asset.
For these purposes, the expression ‘rate of exchange’ must be taken to mean the rate of exchange determined
or recognised by the Central Government for the conversion of Indian Rupee into foreign currency or vice-versa.
In cases where the whole or part of the liability in respect of the payment for the cost of the asset or in respect of
the money borrowed from a foreign source for acquiring the capital asset is met not by the assessee but directly
or indirectly by any other person or authority, the liability so met by the other persons should not be taken into
account for the purposes of any adjustment in the actual cost of the asset and consequently the depreciation
allowable to the assessee arising from the change in the rate of exchange of the currency. If, at the time of
change in the rate of exchange arising on account of devaluation or otherwise the actual cost of the asset has
been fully paid by the assessee and no money remains outstanding in respect of any sum borrowed specifically
for the purpose, no adjustment would be permissible to the assessee. The special provision would, however,
apply only in respect of capital expenditure or the value of the capital asset and would not in any way affect the
value of the current assets, such as stock-in-trade or other trading assets.
Section 43A of the Income-tax Act, 1961 has been amended by the Finance Act, 2002,w.e.f. Assessment Year
2003-04, providing that where a capital asset has been acquired from a foreign country, the addition or deduction
from the actual cost of the asset on account of change in the rate of exchange in any previous year shall be
allowed to be made only on actual payment by the assessee towards the cost of the asset or repayment of the
foreign loan or interest, irrespective of the method of accounting adopted by him.
But, where an addition to or deduction from the actual cost or expenditure or cost of acquisition has been made
under this section, under old provision, on account of an increase or reduction in the liability as aforesaid, the
amount to be added to, or, as the case may be, deducted under this section from, the actual cost or expenditure
or cost of acquisition at the time of making the payment shall be so adjusted that the total amount added to, or,
as the case may be, deducted from, the actual cost or expenditure or cost of acquisition, is equal to the increase
or reduction in the aforesaid liability taken into account at the time of making payment.

SPECIAL PROVISION FOR COMPUTATION OF COST OF ACQUISITION OF CERTAIN ASSETS
(SECTION 43C)
Where an asset [other than those referred to in Section 45(2)] which becomes the property of an amalgamated
company under a scheme of amalgamation, is sold after February 29, 1988 as stock in trade the cost of acquisition
of the asset to the amalgamated company shall be the cost of acquisition of the asset to the amalgamating
company as increased by the cost, if any, of any improvement made thereto and the expenditure if any, incurred
wholly and exclusively in connection with such transfer.
Where an asset [other than those referred to in Section 45(2)] which becomes the property of the assessee on

252 EP-TL&P
the total or partial partition of a HUF or under a gift or will or an irrevocable trust is sold after February 29, 1988,
as stock in trade, then, in computing the profits and gains from sale of such assets, the cost of acquisition of the
said asset to the assessee shall be the cost of acquisition of the said asset to the transferor or the donor, as the
case may be, as increased by the cost, if any, incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with such transfer,
including the payment of gift-tax, if any, incurred by the transferor or the donor, as the case may be.

COMPUTATION OF INCOME UNDER THE HEAD “PROFITS AND GAINS OF BUSINESS OR
PROFESSION” FOR TRANSFER OF IMMOVABLE PROPERTY IN CERTAIN CASES (SECTION 43CA)
Currently, when a capital asset, being immovable property, is transferred for a consideration which is less than
the value adopted, assessed or assessable by any authority of a State Government for the purpose of payment
of stamp duty in respect of such transfer, then such value (stamp duty value) is taken as full value of consideration
under section 50C of the Income-tax Act. These provisions do not apply to transfer of immovable property, held
by the transferor as stock-in-trade.
This section has been inserted with effect from assessment year 2014-15 where the consideration for the
transfer of an asset (other than capital asset), being land or building or both, is less than the stamp duty value,
the value so adopted or assessed or assessable by any authority of state government for the purpose of payment
of stamp duty in respect of such transfer the value so adopted or assessed or assessable shall for the purpose
of computing income under the head “Profits and gains of business of profession” shall be deemed to be the full
value of the consideration received or accruing as a result of such transfer.
Where the date of an agreement fixing the value of consideration for the transfer of the asset and the date of
registration of the transfer of the asset are not same, the stamp duty value may be taken as on the date of the
agreement for transfer and not as on the date of registration for such transfer.
However, this exception shall apply only in those cases where amount of consideration or a part thereof for the
transfer has been received by any mode other than cash on or before the date of the agreement.

SPECIAL PROVISION IN CASE OF INCOME OF PUBLIC FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ETC.
(SECTION 43D)
Section 43D has been inserted by Finance (No. 2) Act, 1991 w.e.f. 1.4.1991. This section provides that in the
case of a public financial institution or a scheduled bank or a state financial corporation or a state industrial
investment corporation, the income by way of interest on such categories of bad and doubtful debts as may
be prescribed having regard to the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India in relation to such debts
shall be chargeable to tax in the previous year in which it is credited to profit and loss account by such
institution referred above for that year or in the previous year in which it is actually received by them whichever
is earlier.
With a view to improve the viability of leasing finance companies, the section has been amended to provide that
in case of a public company, the income by way of interest in relation to such categories of bad and doubtful
debts as may be prescribed having regard to the guidelines issued by the National Housing Bank established
under the National Housing Bank Act, 1987 in relation to such debt shall be chargeable to tax in the previous
year in which it is credited to the profit and loss account by the said public company for that year or in the
previous year in which it is actually received by it, whichever is earlier.

SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATED TO INSURANCE BUSINESS (SECTION 44)
The profits and gains of any business of insurance must, according to Section 44, be computed in accordance
with the rules contained in the First Schedule to the Income-tax Act. For the purpose of the computation, it is
immaterial whether the insurance business is carried on by mutual insurance company or by a co-operative
society or by any other person. The rules contained in the Schedule would apply notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in the provisions of the Income-tax Act relating to the computation of income chargeable

Lesson 4

Part III : Income From Business or Profession

253

under the head ‘Interest on Securities’, ‘income from house property’, ‘capital gains’, or ‘income from other
sources’ or under the head ‘income from business or profession’.

SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR DEDUCTION IN CASE OF TRADE, PROFESSIONAL OR SIMILAR
ASSOCIATIONS (SECTION 44A)
Section 44A of the Income-tax Act provides for a special deduction in the case of any trade, professional or
similar association which is not exempt from Income-tax under Section 10(23A). This deduction is allowable in
cases where the amount received during the accounting year by the trade, professional or other associations
from its members, whether by way of subscription or otherwise, falls short of the expenditure actually incurred
by such association during that accounting year solely for the purpose of protection or advancement of the
common interest of the members. Moneys received by way of remuneration for running any specific services to
the members would not, however, be treated as forming part of income of the association for this purpose.
Consequently, in calculating the amount of deficiency, these receipts would be taken into account and would be
allowed as deduction so as to reduce the amount of deficiency. Similarly, capital expenditure and also expenditure
deductible in computing the income of the assessee under any other provision of the Act, would not be taken
into account in determining the amount of deficiency. The amount of deficiency would be allowable as a deduction
in computing the income of the association assessable for the relevant assessment year under the head ‘profits
and gains from business or profession’. If there is no income assessable under this head or the amount of
deficiency allowable to the assessee exceeds the income under this head, the whole or the balance of the
amount of deficiency, as the case may be, shall be allowed as a deduction in computing the income of the
association assessable for that assessment year under any other head. The amount of deficiency shall not,
however, be allowed to be carried forward for any subsequent year.
The amount of deficiency to be allowed as deduction under Section 44A should not, in any case, exceed 50% of
the total income of the association computed before making any allowance under this section. This section,
however, applies only to that trade, professional or other similar associations, the income of which or any part
thereof is not distributed to its members except as grants to any institution or association affiliated to it. In
computing the income of the association for the relevant assessment year in which the deficiency falls allowable,
the other provisions of the Act granting deductions and allowances must be given effect to before the deficiency
under this section could be allowed. Likewise, losses from any earlier year which are brought forward and
qualify for being set off, must be allowed to be set off before the deficiency under this section is sought to be
allowed as deduction.

SPECIAL PROVISION FOR COMPUTING PROFITS AND GAINS OF BUSINESS ON PRESUMPTIVE
BASIS (SECTION 44AD)
The provisions of this section shall be applicable on any business except the business of plying, hiring or leasing
goods carriages referred to in section 44AE and whose total turnover or gross receipts in the previous year does
not exceed an amount of one crore. This section is inserted by Finance Act, 2009 for providing relief to all the
small businesses from maintaing the books of accounts and to reduce the compliance and administrative burden.
– This section will cover an individual, Hindu undivided family or a partnership firm, other than Limited
Liability Partnership firm and who has not claimed deduction under any of the sections 10A, 10AA, 10B,
10BA or deduction under any provisions of Chapter VIA.
[Note: Total turnover/ gross receipt of the business during the previous year should not exceed
Rs. 2 crore - Amendment vide Finance Act, 2016 w.e.f. AY 2017-18].
– A sum equal to eight per cent of the total turnover or gross receipts of the assessee in the previous year
shall be deemed to be the profits and gains of such business chargeable to tax under the head “Profits
and gains of business or profession further the assessee have the option to claim a sum higher than
eight per cent of the total turnover or gross receipts.

254 EP-TL&P
– No deduction shall be allowed to the assessee under sections 30 to 38 the salary and interest paid to
the partners shall not be allowed for deduction subject to the conditions and limits specified in section
40(b)
[Salary and interest paid to partners is not allowed as deduction to partnership firm from estimated
income - Amendment vide Finance Act, 2016 w.e.f. AY 2017-18].
– The written down value of any asset of an eligible business shall be deemed to have been calculated as
if the eligible assessee had claimed and had been actually allowed the deduction in respect of the
depreciation for each of the relevant assessment years.
– Where an eligible assessee declares profits for any previous year at the rate of 8% of the turnover under
section 44AD and he declares profit for any of the 5 consecutive subsequent assessment year at lower
than 8% , he shall not be eligible to claim the benefit of provisions of section 44AD for 5 subsequent
assessment years (i.e. subsequent to the assessment year relevant to the previous year in which the
profit has not been declared at rate of 8%). In other words during these 5 subsequent years he will have
to maintain his books of accounts as per section 44AA (irrespective of his turnover) and will have to get
his accounts audited under section 44AB (irrespective of turnover) if his total income exceeds exemption
limit.
– An assessee opting for section 44AD is required to pay entire tax on estimated income on Advance
basis w.e.f. AY 2017-18 (earlier assessee opting for section 44AD was exempt from provisions of
Advance tax)
– The provisions of this section, notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing provisions, shall not
apply to –
(i) a person carrying on profession as referred to in sub-section (1) of section 44AA;
(ii) a person earning income in the nature of commission or brokerage; or
(iii) a person carrying on any agency business.
It means that section 44AA and 44AB shall be applicable only if assessee does not opt for presumptive taxation
and his total income exceeds the taxable limit.
Presumptive taxation for professionals
The existing scheme of taxation provides for a simplified presumptive taxation scheme for certain eligible persons
engaged in certain eligible business only and not for persons earning professional income. In order to rationalize
the presumptive taxation scheme and to reduce the compliance burden of the small tax payers having income
from profession and to facilitate the ease of doing business, a new section 44ADA has been inserted to provide
presumptive taxation regime for professionals.
– New Section 44ADA has been inserted to provide for estimating the income of an assessee (individual,
HUF, partnership firm but not limited liability partnership firms) engaged in any profession referred in
section 44AA(1) such as legal, medical, engineering or architectural, accountancy, technical consultancy,
interior decoration or any other profession as is notified by the Board.
– Total Gross receipts should not exceed Rs. 50 lakhs.
– Income shall be estimated @ 50% of the total gross receipts.
– Deductions u/s 30 to 38 deemed to have been allowed (Including interest and remuneration to partners
in case of partnership firm)
– Assessee is not be required to maintain books of accounts u/s 44AA and gets the accounts audited u/s
44AB unless it claims that the profit and gains from the profession is lower than the deemed profit and
gains and its income exceeds the maximum amount which is not chargeable to income tax.

This amendment effective from 1st April, 2017 and accordingly apply in relation to assessment year
2017-18 and subsequent assessment years.

SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR COMPUTING PROFITS AND GAINS OF BUSINESS OF PLYING,
HIRING OR LEASING GOODS CARRIAGES (SECTION 44AE)
Section 44AE provides for a system for estimating the income of an assessee engaged in the business of plying,
hiring or leasing of goods carriages. The scheme is applicable to an assessee who owns not more than ten
goods carriages at any time during the previous year and who is engaged in the business of plying, hiring or
leasing of such goods carriages. The profits and gains of each goods carriage shall be estimated as `7,500 for
every month (or part of a month) for all types goods carriage without any distinction between heavy goods
vehicle (HGV) and vehicle other than HGV.
The assessee may however declare a higher income.

(iv) Where profits and gains from business are deemed to be profits and gains under section 44AE or

(v) where the provisions of section 44AD(4) are applicable to him and his total income exceeds the maximum
amount which is not chargeable to income tax.
Under presumptive assessment under sections mentioned above, if assessee claims that his income is lower
than that specified under these sections, assessee is required to gets his accounts audited by a Chartered
Accountant and copy of that report needs to be attached alongwith his return of income. Therefore to gets his
accounts audited he needs to maintain such books to substantiate his claim and also to enable Chartered
Accountant to issue Audit Report to this effect.
For details students may refer to Rule 6F also for specified books to be maintained.

COMPULSORY AUDIT OF ACCOUNTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS CARRYING ON BUSINESS OR
PROFESSION (SECTION 44AB)
Section 44AB makes it obligatory for
1. a person to get his accounts audited before the ‘specified date’ by an ‘accountant’ if the total sales,
turnover or gross receipts in business for the previous year exceed or exceeds `1 crore or
2. a person carrying on profession will also have to get his accounts audited before the specified date, if
his gross receipts in profession for a previous year or years relevant to any of the aforesaid assessment
years exceed `25 lakhs. [The above limit of Rs. 25 lakh has been increased to Rs. 50 lakh Amendment vide Finance Act, 2016 w.e.f. AY 2017-18]
The provision also casts an obligation on such persons to furnish by the ‘specified date’ a report of the audit in
the prescribed form duly signed and verified by the accountant setting forth such particulars as may be prescribed
by rules made in this behalf by the Central Board of Direct Taxes. In cases where accounts are required to be
audited by or under any other law, it will suffice if the accounts are audited under such other law before the
specified date and the assessee furnishes by that the said date the report of the audit as required under such
other law.
Where profits and gains from business are deemed to be profits and gains under section 44AE or Section 44BB
or Section 44BBB as the case may be and assessee has claimed his income to be lower than the profits and
gains then such profits and gains shall be deemed to be profits and gains of his business during the previous
year or
Every person carrying on profession is required to get his accounts audited, if the total gross receipts from
profession during previous year exceeds Rs. 50 lakhs.
Assessee carrying on business will have to get his accounts audited(irrespective of quantum of turnover or
gross receipt), where the provisions of section 44AD(4) are applicable to him and his total income exceeds the
maximum amount which is not chargeable to income tax.
If a person is covered by section 44ADA and he declares his income from profession lower than deemed
income, he will have to get his accounts audited under section 44AB (irrespective of quantum of turnover or
gross receipt). However, this rule is not applicable if his total income does not exceed exemption limit.
Under presumptive assessment under sections mentioned above, if assessee claims that his income is lower
than that specified under these sections, assessee is required to gets his accounts audited by a Chartered
Accountant and copy of that report needs to be attached alongwith his return of income. Therefore to gets his
accounts audited he needs to maintain such books to substantiate his claim and also to enable Chartered
Accountant to issue Audit Report to this effect.
However, as amended by the Finance Act, 1992, the provision of this section of compulsory audit shall not apply
to those assessees who derive income under Section 44BBA on and from April 1, 1985 or, as the case may be,
the date on which the relevant section came into force, whichever is later.

260 EP-TL&P
The term ‘accountant’ will have the same meaning as in the explanation to Sub-section (2) of Section 288 of the
Income-tax Act and the term “Specified date”, in relation to the accounts of the assessee of the previous year
relevant to an assessment year means the 31st day of October of the assessment year.
According to Section 271B, if any person fails without reasonable cause to get his accounts audited in respect
of any previous year or years relevant to an assessment year or to furnish a report of such audit as required
under the aforesaid provision, or furnish the said report along with the return of his income, the Assessing
Officer may direct that such person shall pay, by way of penalty, a sum equal to 1/2% of total sales, turnover or
gross receipts, as the case may be, in the business, or the gross receipts in the profession of such previous year
or years, subject to a maximum of ` 1.5 lakh.

an obligatory expenditure in connection with the business.
(m) Interest paid for funds borrowed specifically for the acquisition of a capital asset is allowable u/s 36(1)(iii)
as it is incurred for the purpose of the business.

Notes :
1. Restrictions on advertisement and entertainment abolished.
2. With the abolition of Section 37(3), which inter alia governed the deductibility of advertising expenses,
advertising too has come within the fold of the omnibus Section 37(1) which specifically frowns on
capital expenditure. The Himachal Pradesh High Court verdict in Mohan Meakin Breweries Ltd. v. CIT
(1979) 118 ITR 101 allowing capital expenditure on advertising therefore has ceased to have the force
of law as it was rendered in the context of Section 37(3).
3. Advertisement expenses of ` 12,000 (i.e. with in the limit of ` 20,000) is paid in cash, hence admissible.
4. The ‘due date’ for filing return where the assessee is a person (other than a company) who is required
to get his accounts audited under the Income-tax Act or any other law is September 30; and where the
assessee is a person deriving income from business and who is not required to get his accounts audited,
the ‘due date’ is July, 31.
Under the provisions of Section 43B of the Act - Bonus ` 46,000 paid on 13th Nov., 2016 and Commission
` 36,000 paid on 1st Dec., 2015 are not admissible since the payments are made after the above
mentioned ‘due date’.
5. Incentive to workers which is paid on 10th December, 2016 is admissible on ‘due basis’.

Part IV – Income from Capital Gains
LESSON OUTLINE

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

– Capital Gains

The provisions for computation of Income from
capital gains are covered under sections 45 to
55. Section 2(14) defines the term capital gain
and section 45, the charging section lays down
basis of change for taxability of capital gain/loss
arises on transfer of capital asset.

– Capital Asset
– Transfer
– Distribution of assets by companies in
liquidation (Section 46)

Taxability of capital gain depends upon the
nature of capital gain i.e., short term capital gain
or long term capital gain. The type of capital gain
depends upon the period for which the capital
asset is held. The taxability of capital gain shall
satisfy the conditions like there should be capital
asset, the asset is transferred by the assessee,
such transfer takes place during the previous
year, etc. To give relief to the assessee, the
concept of exemption introduced under section
54, 54B, 54D, 54EC, 54F, 54G, 54GA, 54GB
and 54H.

– Short-term and long-term capital gains
– Zero coupon bonds
– Mode of computation and deductions
– Eexmption from Capital Gain Tax
– Lesson Round Up
– Self Test Question

At the end of this lesson, you will learn
– the conditions to be satisfied for income
to be chargeable under this head,
– which assets are classified as capital
asset,
– the year in which the capital gains are
chargeable to tax,
– classification of capital gain into long term
and short term,
– which transactions are not regarded as
transfer,
– what are the exemptions available in
respect of capital gains,
– when can the assessing officer make a
reference to the valuation officer.

277

278 EP-TL&P

CAPITAL GAINS
Sections 45 to 55A of the Income-tax Act, 1961 deal with capital gains.
Section 45 of the Act, provides that any profits or gains arising from the transfer of a capital asset effected in the
previous year shall, save as otherwise provided in Sections 54, 54B, 54D, 54EC, 54ED, 54F, 54G, 54GA and
54H be chargeable to income-tax under the head “Capital Gains” and shall be deemed to be the income of the
previous year in which the transfer took place.
Doubts may arise as to whether ‘Capital Gains’ being a capital receipt can be brought to tax as income. It may be
noted that the ordinary accounting canons of distinctions between a capital receipt and a revenue receipt are not
always followed under the Income-tax Act. Section 2(24)(vi) of the Income-tax Act specifically provides that “Income”
includes “any capital gains chargeable under Section 45(1)”. It may not be out of place to mention here that in the
absence of a specific provision in Section 2(24) capital gains have no logic to be taxed as income. The constitutional
validity of the provisions of the Act relating to capital gains was challenged in Navin Chandra Mafatlal v. C.I.T.
(1955) 27 ITR 245. The Supreme Court while upholding the competence of parliament in legislating with regard to
capital gains as part of income, observed that the term income should be given the widest connotation so as to
include capital gains within its scope. However, all capital profits do not necessarily constitute capital gains. For
instance, profits on re-issue of forfeited shares, profits on redemption of debentures, premium on issue of shares,
‘pagri’ from tenants etc. are capital profits and not capital gains, hence, not liable to tax.
The requisites of a charge to income-tax, of capital gains under Section 45(1) are:
(i) There must be a capital asset.
(ii) The capital asset must have been transferred.
(iii) The transfer must have been effected in the previous year.
(iv) There must be a gain arising on such transfer of a capital asset. These requisites are briefly analyzed below.
(v) Such capital gain should not be exempt under Sections 54, 54B, 54D, 54EC, 54ED, 54F, 54G, or 54GA

CAPITAL ASSET
Unless the gain is relatable to a capital asset there can be no charge to capital gains tax. Section 2(14) of the
Income-tax Act defines the term “capital asset” to mean:
(a) property of any kind held by an assessee, whether or not connected with his business or profession;
(b) any securities held by a Foreign Institutional Investor which has invested in such securities in accordance
with the regulations made under the securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992,
but does not include –
(i) any stock-in-trade, consumable stores or raw-materials held for the purposes of his business or
profession;
(ii) personal effects that is to say, movable property (including wearing apparel and furniture but excluding
jewellery) held for personal use by the assessee or any member of his family dependent on him. Jewellery
includes ornaments made of gold, silver, platinum or any other precious metal or any alloy containing
one or more of such precious metals, whether or not containing any precious or semi-precious stone,
and whether or not worked or sewn into any wearing apparel and precious or semi-precious stones,
whether or not set in any furniture, utensil or other article or worked or sewn into any wearing apparel;
(iii) agricultural land in India, not being land situate (a) within the jurisdiction of a municipality or a contonment

board and which has a population of not less than 10,000, or (b) in any area within the distance, measured
aerially, –
(I) not being more than two kilometres, from the local limits of any municipality or cantonment board
referred to in item (a) and which has a population of more than ten thousand but not exceeding one
lakh; or
(II) not being more than six kilometres, from the local limits of any municipality or cantonment board
referred to in item (a) and which has a population of more than one lakh but not exceeding ten lakh; or
(III) not being more than eight kilometres, from the local limits of any municipality or cantonment board
referred to in item (a) and which has a population of more than ten lakh.
Explanation.– For the purposes of this sub-clause, "population" means the population according to the last
preceding census of which the relevant figures have been published before the first day of the previous year;
(iv) 6½ per cent Gold Bonds, 1977 or 7 per cent Gold Bonds, 1980 or National Defence Gold Bonds, 1980
issued by the Central Government;
(v) Special Bearer Bonds 1991 issued by the Central Government.
(vi) Gold Deposit Bonds issued under the Gold Deposit Scheme, 1999 notified by the Central Government.
Or deposit certificates issued under gold monetisation scheme, 2015 – Amendment vide Finance
Act, 2016.
Any security held by foreign institutional investor which has invested in such security in accordance with the
regulations made under the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 would be treated as capital asset
only so that any income arising from transfer of such security by a Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) would be in
the nature of capital gain.
The Supreme Court in the case of Vodafone International Holdings B.V vs. Union of India [2012] 204 Taxman
408 held that influence/persuasion of a parent company over its subsidiary could not be construed as a right in
the legal sense.
To supersede this ruling with retrospective effect from 1st April 1962, an Explanation has been inserted to clarify
that ‘property’ includes and shall be deemed to have always included any rights in or in relation to an Indian
company, including rights of management or control or any other rights whatsoever.
The term property appearing in Section 2(14) has not been defined in the Income-tax Act. Even the Transfer of
Property Act does not contain any definition of the term. But, the scope of Section 2(14) is very wide. With the
exception of the aforementioned assets, all other assets are included in the category of capital asset. “Capital
asset” includes movable/immovable asset, tangible/intangible assets, incorporeal rights and chose-in-action. It
would also include share of a partner in a firm, goodwill of a firm, mining rights, industrial licence acquired by
consideration, tenancy right or leasehold right, foreign currency, right to subscribe for shares, the contractual right of
a purchaser to obtain title to an immovable property, etc. Some of the judicial rulings in this context are as follows:
Property is a term of widest importance and subject to any limitation which the context may require, it signifies
every possible interest which a person can hold and enjoy [Ahmed G.H. Arif v. C.W.T. (1970) 76 ITR 471 (SC)].
Even business interest would be brought within the term property [C.I.T. v. Krishna Warrier (1964) 53 ITR 176
(SC)]. Even the business undertaking as a whole would fall within the definition of the term ‘property’ in Section
2(14) of the Act. [R.C. Cooper v. Union of India AIR 1970 (SC) 564]. The Gujarat High Court has rightly summed
up as follows: The words “property of any kind”, are words of widest amplitude. They exclude any limitation
which may be sought to be introduced for the purpose of restricting the applicability of the definition. The adverbial
clause “whether or not connected with his business or profession” also emphasizes the width and amplitude of
the definition. Every kind of property held by an assessee, whatever be it’s nature or character, is within the
connotation of the expression ‘capital asset’ provided, of course, it does not fall within the excepted categories

Cost of Self generated Capital Assets: The Madras High Court in C.I.T. v. V.K. Rathnam Nadar (1969) 71 ITR
433 held that capital gain arises only on the transfer of capital asset which had actually cost something to the
assessee. Such actual cost in the context of the Income-tax Act being cost in terms of money, it cannot apply to
transfer of capital asset which did not cost anything to the assessee in terms of money in its creation or acquisition.
In other words, though self generated asset like goodwill is a capital asset in general law, its sale or transfer
would not attract tax on capital gains in the hands of the person who has created it by carrying on his business
or profession, as the coming into existence or growth of self-created assets does not cost anything in terms of
money. The Delhi, Calcutta, Kerala and Karnataka High Courts have taken the same view.
However, with effect from Assessment Year 1988-89, Section 55 is amended to remove this legal difficulty. It
provides that where goodwill is self-generated, the cost of acquisition for computation of capital gain shall be
deemed to be nil and where it has been purchased, the cost will be taken to be the actual price paid for it. The
cost of improvement also in relation to goodwill be taken to be nil.
The Government has overcome the problem of taxing capital gains on transfer of three other categories of selfgenerated assets: with effect from the assessment year 1995-96, cost of tenancy rights, route permits and
loomhours would also be deemed to be nil.
From Assessment year 2008-09, the scope of Section 2(14) has been expanded with the introduction of taxability
provision with regards to “personal effects being archeological collections”.

TRANSFER
The essential requirement for the incidence of tax on capital gains is the transfer of a ‘capital asset’.
The Supreme court in the case of Vodafone International Holdings B.V vs. Union of India [2012] 204 Taxman
408 gave the following ruling –
(a) the transfer of shares in the foreign holding company does not result in a extinguishment of the foreign
company’s control of the Indian company.
(b) It does not constitute an extinguishment and transfer of an asset situated in India.
(c) Transfer of foreign holding company shares offshore, cannot result in an extinguishment of the holding
companies right of control of the Indian company and the same does not constitute extinguishment and
transfer of an asset/management and control of property situated in India.
To supersede this ruling with retrospective effect from 1st April 1962, Explanation 2 to section 2(47) has been
inserted which defines transfer as follows:
‘Transfer’ includes and shall be deemed to have always included disposing of or parting with an asset or any
interest therein, or creating any interest in any asset in any manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly, absolutely or
conditionally, voluntarily or involuntarily by way of an agreement (whether entered into in India or outside India) or
otherwise, notwithstanding that such transfer of rights has been characterized as being effected or dependent
upon or flowing from the transfer of a share or shares of a company registered or incorporated outside India.
The above transactions would be deemed as a transfer notwithstanding that such transfer of rights has been
characterized as being effected or dependent upon or flowing from the transfer of a share or shares of a company
registered or incorporated outside India.
The distribution of capital assets on the dissolution of a firm, body of individuals or other association of persons,
is also regarded as transfer liable to capital gains tax. For the purposes of computing capital gain in such cases,
the fair-market value of the capital asset on the date of such distribution will be deemed to be the full value of
consideration received or accruing as a result of transfer of the capital asset.

Transactions which do not constitute transfer [Sections 46 and 47]
(i) any distribution of capital assets on the total or partial partition of a Hindu Undivided Family;

which is approved by the Securities and Exchange Board of India established under Section 3 of the

plan of a mutual fund scheme, made in consideration of the allotment to him of a capital asset ,
being unit or units, in the consolidated plan of that scheme of the mutual fund , shall not be
treated as transfer for capital gains purposes [Inserted vide Finance Act, 2016].
Thus, transfer of capital assets falling in any of the categories discussed above would not attract liability to
capital gains tax. The following points should be noted:
The fact that a transfer becomes void under Section 281 of the Act does not in any way preclude levy of capital
gains tax. In the case of transfer of shares held as capital asset, the date of transfer is the date of delivery of the
share certificates to the transferee and not the date of registration of the shares in the name of the transferee in
the register of company. This apart, it is essential that on the date of transfer the asset should have been held as
capital asset in order to attract Section 45 of the Act. Further the notional profit arising from transfer by way of
conversion of capital asset into stock-in-trade will be chargeable to tax in the year in which stock-in-trade is sold.
For the purpose of computing the capital gain in such cases, the fair market value of the capital asset on the date
on which it was converted or treated as stock-in-trade will be deemed to be the full value of consideration
receiving or accruing as a result of the transfer of the capital asset.
The following case laws, on the concept of transfer may also be taken note of:
Where the Tribunal held that having regard to the scheme of amalgamation between the assessee and another
company, no sum could be assessed in the hands of the assessee as no capital gains had accrued to it by
exchange or relinquishment as provided in Section 12B of the 1922 Act, it was held that in view of the decision
in CIT v. Rasiklal Maneklal (HUF) [1974] 95 ITR 656 (Bom.) the order of the Tribunal was to be upheld - CIT v.
Mafatlal Gagalbhai & Co. (P.) Ltd. [1989] 42 Taxman 26/177 ITR 488 (Bom.).
Where the assessee, who is shareholder of company A and company A was amalgamated with another company
B and the assessee received shares of the company B in lieu of the shares of A, neither an ‘exchange’ nor a
‘relinquishment’ takes place and hence no capital gains will be leviable. CIT v. Rasiklal Maneklal (HUF) [1989]
43 Taxman 259/177 ITR 198 (SC).
Handing over of capital asset to firm amounts to a transfer, but no capital gains liable to income-tax accrue to
assessee thereby – Ved Parkash Aggarwal v. CIT (1989) 46 Taxman 31/179 ITR 378 (Punj. and Har.).
Making over of immovable properties by assessee-firm to partners at their book value by making necessary
book entries would not amount to transfer of capital asset within the meaning of Section 2(47) and, therefore,
would not attract capital gains tax – CIT v. Bharati Engg. Corpn. [1989] 46 Taxman 80/180 ITR 32 (Punj. & Har.).
A new Sub-section (1A) has been inserted in Section 45 by the Finance Act, 1999 w.e.f. 1.4.2000. It provides
that where any person receives any money or other assets under an insurance from the insurer on account of
damage to or destruction of any capital asset, as a result of flood, typhoon, hurricane, cyclone, earth quake or
other convulsion of nature or on account of riot or civil disturbance or accidental fire or explosion or because of
action by an enemy or action taken in combating an enemy (whether with or without a declaration of war), then
any profits or gains arising from receipt of such money or other asset shall be chargeable to income tax under
the head ‘capital gains’ and shall be deemed to be the income of such person of the previous year in which such
money or other asset was received.
The money so received or/and fair market value of the other asset received shall constitute the full value of
consideration for the purposes of computation of capital gains.
Revaluation of Asset will not amount to ‘transfer’ and hence will not result into any liability under the Income Tax
Act. [Well Pack Packaging v. CIT (2003) 130 Taxamnn 215 (Mag.)].

Withdrawal of exemption in certain cases (Section 47A)
Section 47A provides that if, at any time, before the expiry of eight years from the date of transfer of a capital
asset by a company to its wholly owned subsidiary company as provided in clauses (iv) or (v) of Section 47, or

Lesson 4

Part IV – Income from Capital Gains

285

by the subsidiary company to the holding company respectively, such capital asset is converted by the transferee
company into or is treated by it as, stock-in-trade of its business, or the parent company (or its nominee) or the
holding company ceases to hold the whole of the share capital of the subsidiary company before the expiry of
the period of eight years aforesaid, the amount of capital gains exempted from tax by virtue of the provisions
contained in Section 47 will be deemed to be income of the transferor company chargeable under the head
“capital gains” of the year in which such transfer took place.
In terms of Section 47A(2) where a person gets exemption from capital gains tax on transfer of his membership
in a recognised stock exchange during the course of corporatisation of his business in terms of Section 47(xi)
and he within three years from the date of such transfer sells any of the shares allotted in lieu thereof by the
company, the capital gains exempted vide Section 47(xi) will become the capital gains of the previous year in
which the shares are transferred.
In terms of Section 47A(3) inserted by Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, if the conditions stipulated regarding the
succession of proprietary concern or firm by the company whereby capital gain is not levied, are not complied
with the benefits availed by the sole proprietor or the firm, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be profit and
gains of the successor company chargeable to tax in the year in which infringement takes place.
As per section 47A(4) where any of the conditions laid down in the proviso to clause (xiiib) of section 47 are not
complied with, the amount of profits or gains arising from the transfer of such capital asset or intangible asset or
share or shares not charged under section 45 by virtue of conditions laid down in the said proviso shall be
deemed to be the profits and gains chargeable to tax of the successor limited liability partnership or the shareholder
of the predecessor company, as the case may be, for the previous year in which the requirements of the said
proviso are not complied with.

DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS BY COMPANIES IN LIQUIDATION (SECTION 46)
Section 46(1) provides that notwithstanding anything contained in Section 45, where the assets of a company
are distributed to its shareholders on its liquidation, such distribution shall not be regarded as a transfer by the
company for the purposes of Section 45. This sub-section applies only to the distribution of capital assets in
specie by a company in liquidation among its shareholders. Capital gains made by the liquidator of a company
on sale of the company’s assets with the object of distributing the sale proceeds among shareholders, are
asessable in the hands of the company [Kannan Rice Mills Ltd. v. C.I.T. (1954) 26 ITR 351]. Further analysis of
this sub-section would reveal that if the distribution is otherwise than on liquidation of the company, this section
cannot be attracted. Moreover, the distribution of assets should have been made to the shareholders of the
company. “Shareholders” would mean registered shareholders only and not the beneficial owners of shares
[Howrah Trading Co. Ltd. v. C.I.T. (1959) 36 ITR 215 (S.C.)].
Sub-section (2) of Section 46 provides that where a shareholder, on the liquidation of a company, receives any
money or other assets from the company, he shall be chargeable to income-tax under the head “capital gains”
in respect of the money so received or the market value of the other assets on the date of distribution, as
reduced by the amount assessed as dividend within the meaning of sub-clause (c) of clause (22) of Section 2
and the sum so arrived at shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration for the purpose of Section 48.
But for this sub-section, any cash or other assets received by a shareholder on liquidation of the company would
not be assessable to tax as capital gains. [C.I.T. v. Chimanlal B. Parikh (1973) 92 ITR 59].
It is once again emphasised that but for the enlarged scope of the definition of the term ‘transfer’ in Section 2(47)
and Section 46(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1961, the money received by a shareholder from the company on
liquidation would not be brought to tax, as the money received by him represents only satisfaction of the right
which belonged to him by virtue of his holding the shares and not by operation of any transaction which amounts
to the sale, exchange, relinquishment or other transfer of his shares [C.I.T. v. Madurai Mills Company Ltd. (1973)
89 ITR 45 (S.C.)]. Thus, the distributed assets and/or moneys which are, as a matter of fact not a consideration
for ‘transfer’ are deemed, under Section 46(2), to be capital gains chargeable to tax.

286 EP-TL&P

SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM CAPITAL GAINS
Any capital gain arising as a result of transfer of a short-term capital asset is known as short-term capital gain.
According to Section 2(42A) of the Income-tax Act:
“Short term” capital asset means a capital asset held by an assessee for not more than thirty-six months
immediately preceding the date of its transfer. In the case of capital assets (being equity or preference share in
a company) held by an assessee for not more than 12 months immediately prior to its transfer.
However, an unlisted security and a unit of a mutual fund (other than an equity oriented mutual fund) shall be a
short-term capital asset if it is held for not more than thirty six months.
The expression “equity oriented fund” shall have the meaning assigned to it in the Explanation to clause (38) of
section 10.
The Finance Act, 2014 as passed by the Lok Sabha has inserted a new proviso in section 2(42A) to provide that
the unlisted shares and units of a Mutual Fund(other than equity oriented fund) shall continue to be deemed to
be long-term capital assets if they have been transferred during the period from April 1, 2014 to July 10, 2014
after holding them for a period of more than 12 months (instead of more than 36 months). This proviso shall be
inserted w.e.f. April 1, 2015.
In determining the period for which a capital asset is held by an assessee, the following must be noted:
(i) In the case of shares held in a company in liquidation, the period subsequent to the date on which the
company goes into liquidation shall be excluded.
(ii) In case the asset becomes the property of the assessee under the circumstances mentioned in Section
49(1) – discussed later in this lesson - the period for which the asset was held by the previous owner
shall be included.
(iii) In the case of the shares in an Indian Company which become the property of the assessee in a
scheme of amalgamation, the period for which the shares in the amalgamating company were held by
the assessee shall be included.
(iv) In the case of a capital asset, being a share or any other security subscribed to by the assessee on the
basis of his right to subscribe to such financial asset or subscribed to by the person in whose favour the
assessee has renounced his right to subscribe to such financial asset, the period shall be reckoned
from the date of allotment of such financial asset;
(v) In the case of a capital assets, being the right to subscribe to any financial asset, which is renounced in
favour of any other person, the period shall be reckoned from the date of the offer of such right by the
company or institution, as the case may be, making such offer.
(vi) In the case of a capital asset, being a financial asset, allotted without any payment and on the basis of
holding of any other financial asset, the period shall be reckoned from the date of the allotment of such
financial asset.
(vii) In the case of a capital asset, being a share or shares in an Indian company, which becomes the
property of the assessee in consideration of a demerger, there shall be included the period for which the
share or shares held in the demerged company were held by the assessee.
(viii) In the case of a capital asset, being trading or clearing rights of a recognized stock exchange in India
acquired by a person pursuant to demutualisation or corporatisation of the recognized stock exchange
in India as referred to in Clause (xiii) of Section 47, there shall be included the period for which the
person was a member of the recognized stock exchange in India immediately prior to such demutualisation
or corporatisation;
(viiia) In the case of a capital asset, being equity share or shares in a company allotted pursuant to
demutualisation or corporatisation of a recognised stock exchange in India as referred to in Clause (xiii)

Lesson 4

Part IV – Income from Capital Gains

287

of Section 47, there shall be included the period for which the person was a member of the recognized
stock exchange in India immediately prior to such demutualisation or corporatisation;

Third proviso inserted in section 2(42A) of the Act
As per section 2(42A) of the Act, “Short-term capital asset" means a capital asset held by an assessee for not
more than thirty-six months immediately preceding the date of its transfer. However, the period of holding of
shares in a company for determination of the nature of capital gains vis-à-vis long-term or short-term was 12
months. However this period was extended to 36 months in the case of unlisted companies by Finance Act (no.
2) of 2014.
The third proviso to section 2(42A) has been inserted vide Finance Act, 2016 as per which in case of unlisted
shares, period of holding for transfer to be considered as a short-term capital asset reduced from 36 months to
24 months.

Long Term Capital Asset
Assets other than short-term capital assets are known as ‘long-term capital assets’ and the gains arising
therefrom are known as ‘long-term capital gains’. In the case of other long- term capital assets, the period of
holding is determinable subject to any rules made by CBDT.

ZERO COUPON BONDS
The Finance Act, 2005 has introduced the procedure regarding the taxation of the income on the Zero Coupon
Bonds being issued on or after 1.6.2005. “Zero Coupon Bond” as defined under Section 2(48) means a bond –
(a) issued by any infrastructure capital company or infrastructure capital fund or public sector company on
or after the 1st day of June, 2005;
(b) in respect of which no payment or benefit is received or receivable before maturity or redemption from
infrastructure capital company or infrastructure capital fund or public sector company; and
(c) which the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify in this behalf.
For the purpose of this clause, the expressions “infrastructure capital company” and “infrastructure capital fund”
shall have the same meanings respectively assigned to them under clauses (a) and (b) of Explanation 1 to
clause (23G) of Section 10.
As per Clause (b) above, the payment of and benefit from zero coupon bond shall be received or receivable
from the issuing company/fund only at the time of maturity or redemption. Consequently, Clause (via) has been
inserted in
Section 2(47) to provide that the maturity or redemption of a zero coupon bond shall be regarded as a transfer.
The profits arising on the transfer of such zero coupon bond shall be chargeable under the head “capital gains”.
Further, Section 2(42A) provides that if such zero coupon bonds are held for not more than 12 months, such
capital asset shall be treated as short-term capital asset and hence shall be subject to short-term capital gain.
On the other hand, where these bonds are held for more than 12 months, such capital gain shall be treated as
long-term capital gain.
The proviso under Section 112(1) includes zero coupon bonds. Therefore, where the tax payable in respect of
any income arising from the transfer of a long-term capital asset being zero coupon bonds exceeds 10% of the
amount of capital gain, before giving effect to the provisions of the second proviso to Section 48 (i.e. before giving
effect to indexed cost) such excess shall be ignored for the purpose of computing the tax payable by the assessee.
In other words, long term capital gain on zero coupon bonds shall be chargeable to tax at minimum of the
following two :
(a) 20% of long term capital gain after indexation of cost of such bonds,or
(b) 10% of long term capital gain before indexation of cost of such bonds.

Part IV – Income from Capital Gains

MODE OF COMPUTATION AND DEDUCTIONS
Section 48 of the Act provides that the income chargeable under the head ‘capital gains’ shall be computed by
deducting from the full value of consideration received or accruing as a result of the transfer of the capital asset
the following amounts, namely (as applicable from the assessment year 1993-94) (i) the expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with such transfer;
(ii) the cost of acquisition of the capital asset and the cost of any improvement thereto.
However, in the case of an assessee who is a non-resident, capital gains arising from the transfer of a capital
asset, being shares in, or debentures of, an Indian company shall be computed by converting the cost of
acquisition, expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with such transfer and the full value of the
consideration received or accruing as a result of the transfer of the capital asset into the same foreign currency
as was initially utilised in the purchase of the shares or debentures, and the capital gains so computed in such
foreign currency shall be reconverted into Indian currency.
Further, the above manner of computation of capital gains shall be applicable in respect of capital gains accruing
or arising from every re-investment thereafter in, and sale of, shares in, or debentures of, an Indian Company.
Where long term capital gain arises from the transfer of a long term capital asset (other than capital gain arising
to a non-resident from the transfer of shares in or debentures of an Indian company), such long term capital
gains will be computed by deducting from the full value of consideration, the expenditure incurred in connection
with the transfer, the ‘indexed cost of acquisition’ and ‘indexed cost of improvement’.
The Finance Act, 1997 has with effect from 1.4.1998 denied the benefit of indexation of cost of bonds and
debentures other than indexed bonds issued by the government.
Provided also that where shares, debentures or warrants referred to in the proviso to Clause (iii) of Section 47
are transferred under a gift or an irrevocable trust, the market value on the date of such transfer shall be deemed
to be the full value of consideration received or accruing as a result of transfer for the purposes of this section.
The RBI has recently permitted Indian corporate to issue rupee denominated bonds outside India as a measure
to enable Indian corporate to raise funds from outside India. For providing relief to non residents who bear risk
of currency fluctuation, w.e.f. AY 2017-18 section 48 has been amended to provide that capital gain , arising in
case of appreciation of rupee between the date of issue and the date of redemption against the foreign currency
in which investment is made , shall be exempt from tax on capital gains.
Benefit of Indexation shall be available in the case of long term capital gain arising on transfer of sovereign Gold
Bonds.
For this purpose:
(i) “foreign currency” and “Indian currency” have the meanings respectively assigned thereto in Section
2 of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, and
(ii) the conversion of Indian currency into foreign currency and the re-conversion of foreign currency
into Indian currency shall be at the rate of exchange prescribed in that behalf;
(iii) ‘indexed cost of acquisition’ means an amount which bears to the cost of acquisition the same
proportion as Cost Inflation Index for the year in which the asset is transferred bears to the Cost Inflation
Index for the first year in which the asset was held by the assessee or for the year beginning on the 1st
day of April 1981 whichever is later;
(iv) ‘indexed cost of any improvement’ means an amount which bears to the cost of improvement the
same proportion as Cost Inflation Index for the year in which the asset is transferred bears to the Cost
Inflation Index for the year in which the improvement to the asset took place; and
(v) ‘cost inflation index’, in relation to a previous year, means such Index as the Central Government
may, having regard to seventy-five per cent of average rise in the Consumer Price Index (urban) the

290 EP-TL&P
immediately preceding previous year to such previous year, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify
in this behalf.
Commission paid to a broker for effecting sale of the asset falls under (i) above. Similarly expenditure incurred on
litigation for getting enhanced compensation is expenditure wholly and exclusively incurred in connection with
transfer of the capital asset and is deductible. [V.A. Vasumathi v. C.I.T. (1980)123 ITR 94 (Ker.)]. However, litigation
expenses incurred for having the shares registered in his name are part of the cost of acquisition and that incurred
for gaining better voting rights is cost of improvement [C.I.T. v. Bengal Assam Investors Ltd. (1969) 72 ITR 319
(Cal.)] (Cost of improvement and cost of acquisition are elaborately explained under para 9). Section 48 of the Act
does not an Assessing Officer from taking into amount sale consideration stated in the deed or actual consideration
received by the assessee whichever is higher. [Interpal Singh Ahuja v. CIT (2006) 103 ITD/100 TTJ 497 (Asr.)].
Formula for computation of –
Indexed Cost of Acquisition and
Indexed Cost of Improvement.

Cost of Acquisition [Section 55(2)]
For the purposes of Sections 48 and 49, ‘cost of acquisition’ of goodwill of a business or a right to manufacture,
produce or process any article or thing, tenancy rights, stage carriage permits or loom hours is:
(i) in the case of acquisition of such asset by the assessee by purchase from a previous owner, cost of
acquisition means the amount of the purchase price; and
(ii) in any other case cost of acquisition shall be Nil.
Cost of an asset acquired before 1.4.1981:
(i) where the capital asset became the property of the assessee before 1.4.1981, cost of acquisition means
the cost of acquisition of the asset to the assessee or the fair market value of the asset as on 1.4.1981
at the option of the assessee and the indexation of cost will be available with reference to such actual
cost of acquisition or the FMV as opted for by the assessee;
(ii) where the capital asset became the property of the assessee by any of the modes specified in Section
49(1) and the capital asset became the property of the previous owner before 1.4.1981 cost of acquisition
means the cost of capital asset to the previous owner or the fair market value of the asset as on
1.4.1981 at the option of the assessee. However the indexation will commence from the year in which
the asset became the property of the assessee and not 1981-82.
If a depreciable capital asset becomes the property of assessee under the circumstances mentioned in para 9,
he has got an option to substitute the fair market value of the asset on April 1, 1981 in place of its cost of
acquisition. If, however, an assessee acquires a depreciable asset in the circumstances, other than those
mentioned in para 9, he cannot opt for fair market value on April 1, 1981 in the place of its cost of acquisition
[Section 50(2) - Rajnagar Vaktapur Ginning, Pressing & Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. CIT (1975) 99 ITR 264 (Guj.) and India
Jute Co. Ltd. v. CIT (1981) 6 Taxman 239 (Cal.)].
Unearned increase in value of land is not to be deducted while determining FMV (Fair Market Value) of property
as on April 1, 1981. [CIT v. Rekha Mathur (2006) 152 Taxman 70 (Mag.) (Del.)].
The option given to the assessee to substitute the fair market value of the asset on 1.4.1981 is to ensure that
capital gains are not computed with reference to some historical cost; and thus mitigate the hardship to some of
the assessees who would have acquired the asset at cheaper cost, fifteen or even twenty years back. Keeping
in view this, the Finance Act, 1992 has introduced the system of indexation which has already been discussed
elsewhere in this chapter.

Lesson 4

Part IV – Income from Capital Gains

291

Cost of assets acquired on liquidation of a company
(iii) where the capital asset became the property of the assessee on the distribution of capital assets of a
company on its liquidation and the assessee has been assessed to income-tax under the head ‘capital
gains’ in respect of that asset under Section 46, ‘cost of acquisition’ means the market value of the asset
on the date of distribution.
Cost of Securities
Cost of original shares, acquired directly from a company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be the actual price
paid therefor just as the cost of rights shares shall be deemed to be the actual price paid therefor to the company
plus any amount to the renouncer. Cost of bonus shares shall be deemed to be Nil. Cost of renunciation of rights
shall also be deemed to be Nil.
Cost on consolidation or conversion of shares
(iv) where the capital asset, being a share or a stock of a company, became the property of the assessee
on –
(a) the consolidation and division of all or any of the share capital of the company into shares of larger
amount than its existing shares;
(b) the conversion of any shares of company into stock;
(c) the reconversion of any stock of company into shares;
(d) the sub-division of any of the shares of the company into shares of smaller amount; or
(e) the conversion of one kind of shares of the company into another kind,
the ‘cost of acquisition’ means the cost of acquisition of the asset calculated with reference to the cost of
acquisition of the shares or stock from which such asset is derived.
In relation to a capital asset, being equity share or shares allotted to a shareholder of a recognised stock
exchange in India under a scheme for corporatisation approved by the Securities and Exchange Board of India
Act, 1992 (15 of 192), shall be the cost of acquisition of his original membership of the exchange.
Example 3: X bought 100 shares of ` 10 each fully paid @ ` 15 per share. The company sub-divided shares into
shares of ` 5 each (fully paid). X later on sold 50 of the shares @ ` 8 each.
`
Sale proceeds or consideration received 50 x ` 8

400

Less : Cost of acquisition: 50 shares now sold by X have been derived from 25 shares
which he had originally acquired @ ` 15 per share. Cost of acquisition of these 50 shares
will be 25 x ` 15

Circular: No. 31 (LXXVII-5)-D, dated 21.9.1962
This circular of the department on the “cost of acquisition” is also worth noting:
Where an assessee acquires an asset by inheritance from a person who in turn had also acquired the same
by inheritance before 1.1.1954 (now 1.4.1981) the assessee has the option of substituting the fair market
value of the asset as at 1.1.1954 (now 1.4.1981) in place of the original cost, if it is to his advantage. On the
basis of this a view could be taken as follows:

292 EP-TL&P
(i) the fair market value of original shares on 1.4.1981 can be adopted if such shares have been substituted
or consolidated after that date, and
(ii) the indexation should be made with reference to either the year of acquisition of original shares or
1.4.1981, whichever is later.

Indexed Cost of Acquisition
Cost of acquisition shall have to be adjusted by the Cost Inflation Index to arrive at the indexed cost of acquisition,
as follows:
For assets acquired before 1.4.1981 by the assessee

Tax on Long-Term Capital Gains (Section 112)
Section 112 has been inserted with effect from April 1, 1993 for computation of Income-tax on Long-term Capital
gains. Long-term Capital gains are taxable at a flat rate 20%.
Income-tax as amended by Finance Act, 1999 & subsequently by Finance Act, 2014 provides that –
In respect of listed securities (other than unit) or units or zero tax coupon bonds, assessees have the option of :
– paying tax @ 20% on long-term capital gain computed by considering the ‘indexed’ cost of acquisition
and improvement; or
– paying tax @ 10% on long-term capital gains computed by considering the actual i.e. the historical cost.
This option can be exercised separately in respect of each transaction i.e. exercise of the first option in respect
of one transaction does not preclude the assessee from exercising the second option in respect of a subsequent
transaction(s) during the same previous year.
Assessees must exercise this choice judiciously on a comparison of tax liability under the two options. In respect
of long-term capital gains from transfer of bonus shares, invariably the second option will be exercised.
The assets covered under this provision are securities defined under Section 2(h) of the Securities Contracts
(Regulation) Act, 1956 listed on any recognised stock exchange in India.
As per Section 2(h) “Securities includes shares, scrips, stocks, bonds, debentures, debenture stock or other
marketable securities of a like nature of any company, Government Securities and other notified instruments.

Lesson 4

Part IV – Income from Capital Gains

295

In respect of such long-term capital gain, deductions under Chapter VIA (i.e. under Sections 80C to 80U) are not
allowed. Further, income other than long term capital gains will be subject to tax at the rates in force.

Costs with reference to certain modes of acquisition
Capital gains are ascertained after taking into consideration the cost of acquisition of the capital asset by the
assessee. The cost of acquisition is easily determinable where the asset has been purchased by the assessee.
In some cases the assessee would have acquired the asset not necessarily by purchase but by the following
modes namely:
(A) Cost to the previous owner
(i) on the distribution of assets on the total or partial partition of a Hindu Undivided Family;
(ii) under a gift or will;
(iii) (a) by succession, inheritance or devolution; or
(b) on any distribution of assets on the dissolution of a firm, body of individuals or other association of
persons where such dissolution has taken place at any time before 1.4.1987; or
(c) on any distribution of assets on the liquidation of a company; or
(d) under a transfer to a revocable or irrevocable trust; or
(e) under any such transfer as is referred to in clause (iv) or clause (v) or clause (vi) or clause (via) of
Section 47 - see para 3 already discussed.
(iv) by the mode referred to in Sub-section (2) of Section 64 at any time after 31.12.1969, by an assessee,
being a Hindu Undivided Family.
In all the above cases, Section 49(1) states that the cost of acquisition of the assets shall be deemed to be the
cost for which the previous owner of the property acquired it, as increased by the cost of any improvement of the
assets, incurred or borne by the previous owner or the assessee as the case may be. ‘Previous owner of the
property’ means the last previous owner of the capital asset who acquired it by a mode other than that referred
to in (i) to (iv) above. An example would make this point clear. X had built a house at a cost of ` 50,000. X gifted
the house to Y, Y to Z and Z to A. The cost of acquisition of the house for A for the purpose of ascertaining any
capital gain arising on the sale of the house by A would be ` 50,000. In other words, since the previous owner,
namely, Z, acquired it free of cost, i.e., by gift, it cannot be said that cost of acquisition of the house for A is nil.
Section 55(3) of the Act provides that where the cost for which the previous owner acquired the property cannot
be ascertained, the cost of acquisition to the previous owner means the fair market value on the date on which
the capital asset became the property of the previous owner.
Note : cost of acquisition of an asset acquired by resulting company shall be the cost for which the demerged
company Acquired the capital asset as increased by the cost of improvement incurred by the demerged company.
(B) Cost of shares in the amalgamated company
Sub-section (2) of Section 49 provides that where the capital asset being a share or shares in an amalgamated
company which is an Indian company became the property of the assessee in consideration of a transfer
referred to in clause (vii) of Section 47, the cost of acquisition of the asset shall be deemed to be the cost of
acquisition to him of the share or shares in the amalgamating company.
(C) Cost of acquisition in cases of conversion of debenture/debenture stock/deposit certificate into
shares
Sub-section 2A, as inserted retrospectively from 1.4.1962 by Finance (No. 2) Act, 1991 states that where the
capital asset being a share or debenture in a company became the property of the assessee in consideration of
a transfer referred to in Section 47(x), the cost of acquisition of the asset to the assessee shall be deemed to be

296 EP-TL&P
that part of the cost of debenture, debenture stock or deposit certificates in relation to which such asset is
acquired by the assessee.
(D) Where the capital gain arises from the transfer of specified security or sweat equity shares referred to in
sub-clause (vi) of clause (2) of section 17, the cost of acquisition of such security or shares shall be the fair
market value which has been taken into account for the purposes of the said sub-clause. [Section 49(2AA)]
(E) Further, Sub-section (3) of Section 49 provides that where the capital gain arising from the transfer of a
capital asset referred to in Section 47(iv) or (v) is deemed, by virtue of the provisions in Section 47A, to be
income chargeable under the head ‘capital gains’, the cost of acquisition of such asset to the transferee company
will be the cost for which such asset was acquired by it.

Cost of Improvement
Section 55(1)(b) provides that where the capital asset became the property of the previous owner or the assessee
before 1.4.1981, the cost of any improvement means all expenditure of a capital nature incurred in making any
additions or alterations to the capital asset on or after the said date by the previous owner or the assessee. In
other cases, it means all capital expenditure in making any additions or alterations by the assessee after it
became his property and where the capital asset became the property of the assessee by any of the modes
specified in Section 49(1) by the previous owner as the case may be. If, however, any part of the expenditure is
deductible in computing the income chargeable under the head “Interest on securities”, “Income from house
property”, “Profits and gains of business or profession” or “Income from other sources”, such expenditure cannot
be included as cost of improvement. For example, a house is bought out of borrowed money. The interest paid
on the loan till the date of completion of construction has been held to be part of cost of acquisition of the house.
But ground rent paid which is deductible while computing income under the head “income from house property”
cannot be taken to be cost of improvement and hence cannot be added to the cost of acquisition.
However, the ‘Cost of any improvement’ at sub-clause (b) of Clause 1 of Section 55, in relation to a capital asset
being goodwill of a business, shall be taken to be nil.
5.52 Capital Gains in case of damage or destruction of Capital Asset (w.e.f. Assessment year 2000-01) [Section
45(1A)]
Where any person receives at any time during the previous year any money or other asset under an insurance
from an insurer on account of damage to or destruction of, any capital asset, as a result of:
(i) flood, typhoon, hurricane, cyclone, earthquake, or other convulsion of nature; or
(ii) riot or civil disturbance; or
(iii) accidental fire or explosion; or
(iv) action by an enemy or action taken in combating an enemy (whether with or without a declaration of war),
then, any profits or gains arising from receipt of such money or other asset shall be chargeable to tax under the
head ‘Capital Gains’. The income shall be deemed to be the income for the previous year in which such money
or other asset is received. For computing capital gains, the value of any money or the fair market value of asset
received on the date of receipt shall be deemed to be the full value of consideration received or accuring as a
result of the transfer of damaged asset.

ADVANCE MONEY RECEIVED
Clause (ix) to sub section (2) of section 56 read with proviso to section 51 (inserted vide Finance Act,
2014) provides that any sum of advance money received and forfeited in the course of negotiations for
transfer of a capital asset, where the negotiations do not result in transfer of such capital asset, shall be
included in the income from other sources. Further, it shall not be deducted from the cost of the asset
acquired or the written down value or the fair market value, as the case may be, in computing the cost of
acquisition.

Lesson 4

Part IV – Income from Capital Gains

TRANSFER OF SECURITIES HELD WITH DEPOSITORY [SECTION 45(2A)]
Where any person has had at any time during the previous year any beneficial interest in securities, then, any
profits or gains arising from transfer made by the Depository or participant of such beneficial interest in respect
of securities shall be chargeable to tax as the income of the beneficial owner of the previous year in which
transfer took place and not of the Depository who is deemed to be the registered owner of Securities.
The cost of acquisition and the period of holding of any securities shall be determined on first-in-first-out basis.
[vide Circular No. 768, dated 24-6-98, issued by CBDT]

COMPUTATION OF CAPITAL GAINS ON PURCHASE BY COMPANY OF ITS OWN SHARES OR
OTHER SPECIFIED SECURITIES (W.E.F. ASSESSMENT YEAR 2000-01)
Where a company purchases its own shares from a shareholder or other specified securities from its holder,
then the capital gains shall be chargeable to tax in the hands of transferor. The capital gains shall be computed
as provided in Section 48 in the year in which such shares or specified securities are purchased by the
company.

BONUS SHARES AND CAPITAL GAINS
The Finance Acts 1994 and 1995 have brought about sweeping changes in computation of capital gains of
shares. Cost of original shares is the actual price paid therefor. Cost of rights shares is the actual price paid
therefor. Cost of bonus shares is nil. In other words, cost of original shares or rights shares will not rub off on
to the bonus shares and its cost will be deemed to be nil as it is obtained free of cost just as cost of rights
shares is not allowed to be influenced by the price paid for the original shares. In other words, from the
assessment year 1996-97, there would be a compartmentalised approach to computation of capital gains in
respect of shares with original shares and its offshoots i.e. rights and bonus remaining separate from one
another. Any amount realised on relinquishment of rights will be taxable in full as cost of such relinquishment
is also deemed to be nil.

COMPUTATION OF CAPITAL GAINS IN RESPECT OF DEPRECIABLE ASSETS (SECTION 50)
The capital gains on depreciable assets are computed as under:
(1) Find out the written down value on the first day of the previous year relevant to the assessment year of
all those depreciable assets on which the depreciation is allowed at the same rate. All such assets are
known as ‘block of assets’.
(2) If any new asset of the same block is purchased during the previous year, the cost of such asset shall be
included in the balance at step (1).
(3) If any asset is sold out of such block during the previous year, the net consideration shall be deducted
from the balance under (2).
(4) Computation of depreciation at the prescribed rate on the balance under (3) and deduction thereof from
the same balance.
(5) The balance under (4) shall be the written down value of the ‘block of assets’ for the next year.
It means if the net consideration of an asset out of the block is less than the balance under (2), there would be
no capital gain. If the net consideration of an asset is more than the balance under (2) (the value of all assets in
the block) the excess shall be deemed to be short term capital gain. If all the assets of the block are sold in the
previous year and the net consideration is less than the balance under (2), the loss shall be deemed to be shortterm capital loss.
Where subject matter of transfer is an asset on which deduction on account of depreciation under Section

298 EP-TL&P
32(1)(i) has been claimed and obtained by the assessee in any previous year, the cost of acquisition of the asset
shall be the written down value as defined in Section 43(6).

COST OF ACQUISITION AND CAPITAL GAIN IN CASE OF DEPRECIABLE ASSETS OF
ELECTRICITY COMPANIES [SECTION 50A]
Where the capital asset is an asset in respect of which an undertaking engaged in generation or generation and
distribution of power has claimed depreciation at certain percentage on actual cost under Section 32(1)(i), in any
previous year, than for purpose of computing capital gain on such assets, the cost of acquisition shall be the
actual cost at which the asset was acquired by such undertaking and it shall not be the written down value as
adjusted, as is applicable for other assessee’s. However, on such transfer, the difference between the actual
cost and the WDV of such asset shall be balancing charge taxable under Section 41(2). Further in this case,
there can be long-term capital gains if the asset is held for more than 36 months.

SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR COMPUTATION OF CAPITAL GAINS IN CASE OF SLUMP SALE
[SECTION 50B]
Any profits or gains arising from the slump sale, effected in the previous year, shall be chargeable to income-tax
as capital gains arising from the transfer of long-term capital assets and shall be deemed to be the income of the
previous year in which the transfer took place. However, if the undertaking is owned and held by the assessee
for not more than 36 months immediately preceding the date of transfer, then such slump sale will result into
short-term capital gain. On the other hand, if such undertaking is owned and held by the assessee for more than
36 months immediately preceding the date of transfer, it shall be deemed to be long-term capital gains irrespective
of the fact that such undertaking has acquired certain assets which are held for less than 36 months.
Meaning of slump sale [Section 2(42C)]‘
Slump sale’ means the transfer of one or more undertakings as a result of the sale for a lump sum consideration
without values being assigned to the individual assets and liabilities in such sales. In other words it is a sale
where the assessee transfers one or more undertaking as a whole including all the assets and liabilities as a
going concern. The consideration is fixed for the whole undertaking and received by the transferor it is not
fixed for each of the asset of the undertaking as a whole by way of such sale.
Thus it may be noted that the undertaking as a whole or the division transferred shall be a capital asset.

COMPUTATION OF CAPITAL GAIN IN REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION [SECTION 50C]
Section 50C makes a special provision for determining the full value of consideration in cases of transfer of
immovable property. It provides that where the consideration declared to be received or accruing as a result of
the transfer of land or building or both, is less than the value adopted or assessed by any authority of a State
Government (i.e. “stamp valuation authority”) for the purpose of payment of stamp duty in respect of such
transfer, the value so adopted or assessed shall be deemed to be the full value of the consideration, and capital
gains shall be computed on the basis of such consideration under Section 48 of the Income-tax Act.
Rationalization of section 50C in case sale consideration is fixed under agreement executed prior to the
date of registration of immovable property (w.e.f. AY 2017-18)
– Section 50C of the Act has been amended in line with section 43CA to provide that where the date of the
agreement fixing the amount of consideration and the date of registration for the transfer of the capital
asset are not the same, the value adopted or assessed or assessable by the stamp valuation authority
on the date of agreement may be taken for the purposes of computing full value of consideration for
such transfer.
– It is further provided that this provision shall apply only in a case where the amount of consideration
referred to therein, or a part thereof, has been received by way of an account payee cheque or account

payee bank draft or by use of electronic clearing system through a bank account, on or before the date
of the agreement of transfer.

FAIR MARKET VALUE TO BE FULL VALUE OF CONSIDERATION IN CERTAIN CASES (SECTION
50D)
Capital gains are calculated on transfer of a capital asset, as sale consideration minus cost of acquisition. In
some recent rulings, it has been held that where the consideration in respect of transfer of an asset is not
determinable under the existing provisions of the Income-tax Act, then, as the machinery provision fails, the
gains arising from the transfer of such assets is not taxable.
Section 50D has been inserted to provide that fair market value of the asset shall be deemed to be the full value
of consideration if actual consideration is not attributable or determinable.

REFERENCE TO VALUATION OFFICER (SECTION 55A)
With a view to ascertaining the fair market value of a capital asset, the concerned Assessing Officer may refer the
valuation of the capital asset to a Valuation Officer appointed by the Income-tax Department in the following cases:
(a) Where the value of the asset as claimed by the assessee is in accordance with the estimate made by a
registered valuer (who works in a private capacity under a licence issued by the Board and his valuation
is not binding on the Assessing Officer), but the Assessing Officer is of the opinion that the value so
claimed is less than its fair market value (upto june 30, 2012) w.e.f 1st july 2012, the Assessing Officer is
enabled to make a reference to the Valuation Officer where in his opinion the value declared by the
assessee is at variance from the fair market value [Section 55A(a)].
(b) Where the Assessing Officer is of the opinion that the fair market value of the asset exceeds the value
of the asset by more than ` 25,000 or 15 per cent of the value claimed by the assessee whichever is
less [Section 55A(b)(i) read with Rule 111AA].
(c) Where the Assessing Officer is of the opinion that, having regard to the nature of an asset and relevant
circumstances, it is necessary so to make a reference to the Valuation Officer [Section 55A(b)(ii)].
It may be noted that in a case where the assessee has opted for substitution of the cost of acquisition of an
asset by its fair market value as on 1.4.1981, the fair market value as claimed by him may be higher than its
actual fair market value. The provisions of Section 55A(a) and (b)(i) are, therefore, not applicable to such a
case. It is, however, open to the Assessing Officer to make a reference to the Valuation Officer under
Section 55A(b)(ii).
Note that in cases covered by Section 55A(a) and (b)(i) above it is the duty of the Assessing Officer to refer the
valuation of the capital asset in question to the Valuation Officer attached to the department and not to decide
the question of the valuation on his own.

Part IV – Income from Capital Gains

CAPITAL GAINS EXEMPT FROM TAX
Under Sections 54, 54B, 54D, 54EC, 54F, 54G and 54H of the Act, capital gains arising from the transfer of
certain capital assets are exempt from tax under certain circumstances. These provisions are dealt with section
wise below.

Profit on sale of property used for residence (Section 54)
Where any capital gain arises to an assessee, individual or H.U.F., on the transfer of a long-term residential
house (either self-occupied or let out), the income of which is chargeable under the head, ‘Income from house
property’, and where the assessee (or in case of his death, his legal representative) has (i) purchased one
residential house in India within a period of one year before such transfer or within a period of two years after
such transfer, or (ii) constructed one residential house in India within three years after such transfer, the capital
gain arising on such transfer is to be treated in the following manner:
(i) The capital gain arising on the transfer of such residential house is exempt to the extent it is re-invested
in the purchase or construction of another residential house within the period as aforesaid. If the entire
capital gain is re-invested, it is fully exempt from income-tax and not includible in the total income of the
asessee. If only a part thereof is re-invested, the balance is chargeable to income-tax. The allotment of
flats under self-financing scheme of Delhi Development Authority is treated as a new construction for
the purposes of capital gain exemption (under Section 54). Exemption under this section is available
only if the investment is made in one residential house situated India.
(ii) The new residential house so purchased or constructed should not be transferred within a period of
three years of its purchase or construction as the case may be. If it is transferred within such period of
three years, the cost of the new house so purchased or constructed is to be reduced by the amount of
old exempted capital gain. In other words, the old exempted capital gain and new capital gain, if any
arising on the transfer of the new residential house, both are chargeable to tax as the income of the
previous year in which the new residential house is transferred. If the transfer of the new house is
effected after the expiry of three years of its purchase or construction, the cost of the new house so
purchased or constructed is not to be reduced by the amount of old exempted capital gain. In other
words, the old exempted gain is not taxable in such cases.
(iii) Where the amount of capital gain which is not appropriated or utilised by the assessee for the purchase
of a residential house within one year before the date of the transfer or which is not utilised by him for the
purchase or construction of a new residential house before the date for furnishing the return of income
(under Section 139), the unutilised amount has to be deposited on or before the due date for furnishing
the return of income in an account in any bank or institution specified by the Central Government. The
return of income should be furnished along with proof of such deposit. The amount already utilised for
the purchase or construction of the new residential house together with the amount so deposited shall
be deemed to be the amount utilised for the purchase or construction of the new residential house.
Thus, the assessee is allowed exemption in respect of capital gain so utilised or deposited.
The assessee has to utilise the amount so deposited for the purchase or construction of the new residential
house within the specified period as aforesaid [under Section 54(1)]. When the deposited amount is not so
utilised either wholly or partly for the purchase or construction of the new residential house, the unutilised
amount is treated as capital gain of the relevant previous year in which the period of three years from the date of
such transfer expires.

Transfer of land used for agricultural purposes (Section 54B)
Where any capital gain either long-term or short-term arises on the transfer of land which, in the two years
immediately preceding the date of transfer, was being used by the assessee being an individual or his parents

304 EP-TL&P
or a Hindu Undivided Family for agricultural purposes and where the assessee has purchased any other
agricultural land within a period of two years after the date of its transfer, such capital gain is to be treated as
under:
(i) The capital gain arising on the transfer of old agricultural land is exempt to the extent it is reinvested in the
purchase of any other agricultural land within the aforesaid period. If whole capital gain is reinvested, it is
fully exempt from income-tax and not includible in the total income of the assessee. If only a part of it has
been re-invested, the balance of it is chargeable to income-tax. New land may be in rural or urban area.
(ii) New agricultural land so purchased should not be transferred within three years of its purchase. If it is
sold before the expiry of three years, the cost of the new agricultural land is to be reduced by the amount
of old exempted capital gain [Section 54B(1)].
(iii) The amount of capital gain not utilised by the assessee for purchase of new agricultural land before the
date for furnishing the return of his income is to be deposited by him, on or before the due date for
furnishing the return of income, in an account in any bank or institution specified by the Central
Government. The amount already utilised for the purchase of agricultural land together with the amount
so deposited is deemed to be the amount utilised for the purchase of agricultural land. Accordingly, the
assessee is allowed exemption in respect of capital gain so utilised or deposited [Section 54B(2)].
The assessee is also required to utilise the amount of deposit for the purchase of agricultural land within the
specified period as aforesaid [Section 54B(1)]. If the deposited amount is not so utilised for the purchase of
agricultural land, the unutilised amount is treated as capital gain of the relevant previous year in which the period
of two years from the date of such transfer expires.

Compulsory acquisition of lands and buildings (Section 54D)
An assessee is entitled to exemption from tax in respect of capital gains arising from the transfer, by way of
compulsory acquisition, of any land or building forming part of an industrial undertaking belonging to him provided
the following conditions are satisfied:
(a) The land and buildings form part of an industrial undertaking of the assessee.
(b) It has been so used for at least two years preceding the date of compulsory acquisition.
(c) The assessee purchases any other land and building within a period of three years from the date of
acquisition or constructed a building within such period.
(d) The newly acquired lands and buildings are used for the shifting or re-establishment of old industrial
undertaking or for setting up new industrial unit.
(e) The new asset is not transferred by the assessee for a period of three years from the date of acquisition.
(f) The capital gains are not chargeable to tax to the extent they are utilised in purchasing the land and
building.
Consequences if new land or building is transferred within 3 years:
If new land or building is transferred within a period of three years from the date of its purchase or construction,
the amount of capital gains arising therefrom, together with the amount of capital gains exempted earlier, will be
chargeable to tax in the year of sale of new land and building.

Scheme of deposit
Where the amount of capital gain is not appropriated or utilised by the assessee for purchase of new asset
before the date of furnishing the return of his income, it shall be deposited by him on or before the due date of
furnishing the return of income, in an account with a bank or institutions specified in, and utilised in accordance

Lesson 4

Part IV – Income from Capital Gains

305

with any scheme framed by the Central Government in this regard. The amount already utilised for purchase or
construction of the new asset, together with the amount so deposited, shall be deemed to be the amount utilised
for the purchase of a new asset. If the amount deposited is not utilised fully for purchase or construction of a new
asset within the stipulated period, then the amount not so utilised shall be treated as the capital gain of the
previous year in which the period of three years from the date of transfer of original asset expires. In such case
the assessee shall be entitled to withdraw such amount in accordance with the aforesaid scheme.
The words ‘industrial undertaking’ should be understood to have been used in Section 54D in a wide sense,
taking in its fold any project or business a person may undertake. Thus, the ‘running of a lodge’ can also be said
to be an ‘industrial undertaking’ within the meaning of Section 54D. [P. Alikunju M.A. Nazeer Cashew Industries
v. CIT (1987) 166 ITR 804 (Ker)].

No tax on long-term capital gains if investments made in specified bonds (Section 54EC)
(1) Where the capital gain arises from the transfer of a long-term capital asset (the capital asset so transferred
being hereafter in this section referred to as the original asset) and the assessee has, at any time within a period
of six months after the date of such transfer, invested the whole or any part of capital gains in the long-term
specified asset, the capital gain shall be dealt with in accordance with the following provisions of this section,
that is to say:
(a) if the cost of the long-term specified asset is not less than the capital gain arising from the transfer of the
original asset, the whole of such capital gain shall not be charged under Section 45;
(b) if the cost of the long-term specified asset is less than the capital gain arising from the transfer of the
original asset, so much of the capital gain as bears to the whole of the capital gain the same proportion
as the cost of acquisition of the long-term specified asset bears to the whole of the capital gain, shall not
be charged under Section 45.
(2) Where the long-term specified asset is transferred or converted (otherwise than by transfer) into money at
any time within a period of three years from the date of its acquisition, the amount of capital gains arising from
the transfer of the original asset not charged under Section 45 on the basis of the cost of such long-term
specified asset as provided in Clause (a) or, as the case may be, Clause (b) of Sub-section (1) shall be deemed
to be the income chargeable under the head “Capital gains” relating to long-term capital asset of the previous
year in which the long-term specified asset is transferred or converted (otherwise than by transfer) into money.
Explanation: In a case where the original asset is transferred and the assessee invests the whole or any part of
the capital gain received or accrued as a result of transfer of the original asset in any long-term specified asset
and such assessee takes any loan or advance on the security of such specified asset, he shall be deemed to
have converted (otherwise than by transfer) such specified asset into money on the date on which such loan or
advance is taken.
(3) Where the cost of the long-term specified asset has been taken into account for the purposes of Clause (a)
or Clause (b) of Sub-section (1) –
(a) a deduction from the amount of income-tax with reference to such cost shall not be allowed under
Section 88 for any assessment year ending before the 1st day of April, 2006;
(b) a deduction from the income with reference to such cost shall not be allowed under Section 80C for any
assessment year beginning on or after the 1st day of April, 2006.
(a) “cost”, in relation to any long-term specified asset, means the amount invested in such specified
asset out of capital gains received or accruing as a result of the transfer of the original asset;
(b) “long-term specified asset” means any bond redeemable after three years issued on or after 1st
day of April, 2006.

306 EP-TL&P
Provided further that the investment made by an assessee in the long-term specified asset, from capital gains
arising from transfer of one or more original assets, during the financial year in which the original asset or assets
are transferred and in the subsequent financial year does not exceed fifty lakh rupees.
Benefit of the exemption will be available only if the gains are invested in bonds of NHAI and RECL that are
issued on or after 1-4-2006. (w.e.f. A.Y. 2006-07)
Section 54EC is attracted where long term capital asset is transferred. So an assessee can avail benefit of
Section 54EC with respect to depreciable asset. [CIT v. ACE Builders (P) Ltd. (2005) 144 Taxman 855 (Bom.)].

Capital gains on transfer of certain listed securities or unit, not to be charged in certain cases
(Section 54ED).
The benefit of exemption under this section is being withdrawn w.e.f. A.Y. 2007-08 in respect of asset transferred
on or after 1-4-2006 as long-term capital gain from such shares/units is fully exempt under Section 10(38) and
short-term capital gain from such shares/units is taxable at a special rate of 15%.

original asset or assets are transferred and in the subsequent financial year should not exceed Rs. 50
lakh.
– Amount of exemption: The amount of long term capital gain or amount invested in long term specified
assets, whichever is less.
– Revocation of exemption: The long term specified asset should not be transferred (no loan or advance
should be taken against these assets) within 3 years from the date of its acquisition. In case of violation,
the long term capital gain exempted earlier would be taxable as long term capital gain of the previous
year in which violation takes place.

Capital gain on the transfer of certain capital assets not to be charged in case of investment in
residential house (Section 54F)
Where in the case of an assessee being an individual or a Hindu Undivided Family, the capital gain arises from
the transfer of an long-term capital asset, not being a residential house (hereafter in this section referred to as
the original asset), and the assessee has, within a period of one year before or two years after the date on which

only if the investment is made in one residential house situated in India.

Lesson 4

Part IV – Income from Capital Gains

307

Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply where:
(a) the assessee:
(i) owns more than one residential house, other than the new asset, on the date of transfer of the
original asset; or
(ii) purchases any residential house, other than the new asset, within a period of one year after the
date of transfer of the original asset; or
(iii) constructs any residential house, other than the new asset, within a period of three years after the
date of transfer of the original asset; and
(b) the income from such residential house, other than the one residential house owned on the date of
transfer of the original asset, is chargeable under the head “Income from house property”.
For the purposes of this section “Net consideration” means full value of the consideration received or accruing
as a result of transfer of the capital asset as reduced by any expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in
connection with such transfer.
Forfeiture of the Exemption:
If the assessee sells the newly purchased or constructed house within a period of 3 years of its purchase or
construction, as the case may be, the old exempted long-term capital gain would be chargeable to tax as longterm capital gain in the previous year in which the house so purchased or constructed is transferred. If the
transfer of the new residential house is effected after the expiry of three years of its purchase or construction, the
old exempted long term capital gain is not chargeable to tax [Section 54F(3)].
Sub-section (4) of Section 54F further provides that the net consideration which is not appropriated by the
assessee for the purchase of a residential house within one year before the date of such transfer, or which is not
utilised by him for the purchase or construction of a residential house before the date of furnishing the return of
income (under Section 139), has to be deposited by him before the due date of furnishing the return of income
[under Section 139(1)] in an account in any bank or institution specified by the Central Government. The amount
already utilised by him for the said purpose together with the amount so deposited is deemed to be the cost of
the new asset. Accordingly, the assessee is entitled to exemption in respect of the capital gain on such basis.
The return of income filed by the assessee has to be accompanied by proof of such deposit.
The assessee is required to utilise the amount of deposit for the purchase or construction of a residential house
within the aforesaid specified period [under Section 54F(1)]. If the deposited amount is not so utilised, wholly or
partly, for the purchase/construction of new house within the specified period, the excess amount of exemption
shall be treated as capital gains of the previous year in which the period of three years from the date of the
transfer of the original asset expires.
What is required under this section is that the assessee has used the property for residence and non use of it by
the assessee due some reasons will not disentitle him from eligibility under Section 54F. [Amit Gupta v. CIT
(2006) 6 SC 403 (Del.)].

EXTENSION OF TIME FOR ACQUIRING NEW ASSET OR DEPOSITING OR INVESTING AMOUNT
OF CAPITAL GAIN (SECTION 54H)
Section 54H has been inserted by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1991 with effect from 1.10.1991. This section states
that where the transfer of the original asset is by way of compulsory acquisition under any law and the amount
of compensation awarded for such acquisition is not received by the assessee on the date of such transfer, the
period of acquiring the new asset by the assessee referred to in Sections 54, 54B, 54D, 54EC and 54F or for

i. With a view to providing parity in tax treatment between physical gold and Sovereign Gold Bond, it is provided
by amending the Section 47 of the Income-tax Act, that any redemption of Sovereign Gold Bond under the

ii. The Reserve Bank of India has recently permitted Indian corporates to issue rupee denominated bonds
outside India as a measure to enable the Indian corporates to raise funds from outside India. Accordingly,
with a view to provide relief to non-resident investor who bears the risk of currency fluctuation, it is provided
by amending section 48 of the Act that the capital gains, arising in case of appreciation of rupee between the
date of issue and the date of redemption against the foreign currency in which the investment is made shall
be exempt from tax on capital gains.
This amendment effective from 1st April, 2017 and accordingly apply in relation to assessment year

EXEMPTION FROM DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION TAX (DDT) ON DISTRIBUTION MADE BY AN SPV
TO BUSINESS TRUST
In respect of taxation of business trusts comprising of Real Estate Investment Trust (REITs) and Infrastructure
Investment Trust (Invits) regulated by SEBI a specific taxation regime has been incorporated in the Act. Under
this regime, the multiple taxation due to interposition of business trust is avoided. Under the SEBI regulation,
these business trusts can hold the income generating asset either directly or through a Special Purpose Vehicle
(SPV). The SPV can be a company or an LLP. Under SEBI Regulation, SPV is defined to mean any company or
LLP in which REIT holds or proposes to hold controlling interest which is not less than fifty percent of the equity
share capital or interest. The SPV should hold at least 80% of the assets in properties and not invest in other
SPV. The existing tax regime provides that in case of REITs, the income by way of interest paid by SPV being a
company to REIT is given pass through i.e. it is not taxed at the level of REIT but in the hands of respective
investors of REIT. The rental income from directly held assets by REIT is also allowed a pass through. In respect
of assets held through an SPV, if SPV is a company then the company pays normal corporate tax and thereafter
when the income is distributed to the REIT being a shareholder, it suffers DDT which is paid by the SPV and
thereafter the income is exempt both in the hands of REIT and also its investors. In case of Invits, there is a
similar regime with only exception being that there is no pass through for Invits holding income generating
assets directly as normally such large infrastructure projects are not held directly in the trust but are held through
an SPV. As an incentive in the case of sponsor (the person setting up trust), capital gain arising at time of swap
of its shareholding in SPV for units of business trust is deferred both under normal provisions and from applicability
of MAT. Such gains get taxed only after actual sale of units.
It has been represented by the stakeholders that levy of dividend distribution tax at the level of SPV when it
distributes its current income to the business trust makes the business trust structure tax inefficient and adversely
impacts the rate of return for the investor. This is more so, as under SEBI regulations both the SPV and business
trust are obligated to distribute 90% of their operating income to the investors, whereas in case of normal real
estate company, there is no requirement of such annual distribution of dividends. It has been represented that
because of the additional levy of DDT and associated tax inefficiency, these initiatives have not yet taken off.
In order to further rationalize the taxation regime for business trusts (REITs and Invits) and their investors, a
special dispensation and exemption from levy of dividend distribution tax has been provided. The salient features
of the same dispensation are as under:
a) exemption from levy of DDT in respect of distributions made by SPV to the business trust;
b) such dividend received by the business trust and its investor shall not be taxable in the hands of trust or
investors;
c) the exemption from levy of DDT would only be in the cases where the business trust either holds 100%
of the share capital of the SPV or holds all of the share capital other than that which is required to be
held by any other entity as part of any direction of any Government or specific requirement of any law to
this effect or which is held by Government or Government bodies; and
d) the exemption from the levy of DDT would only be in respect of dividends paid out of current income
after the date when the business trust acquires the shareholding referred in (c) above in the SPV. The
dividends paid out of accumulated and current profits upto this date shall be liable for levy of DDT as
and when any dividend out of these profits is distributed by the company either to the business trust or
any other shareholder.
The amendment takes effect from 1st June, 2016.

– Assets other than short-term capital assets are known as ‘long-term capital assets’ and the gains
arising therefrom are known as ‘long-term capital gains’. Section 48 of the Act provides that the income
chargeable under the head ‘capital gains’ shall be computed by deducting from the full value of
consideration received or accruing as a result of the transfer of the capital asset the f amount of
expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively in connection with such transfer and the cost of acquisition
of the capital asset and the cost of any improvement thereto.
– ‘Cost of acquisition’ of goodwill of a business or a right to manufacture, produce or process any
article or thing, tenancy rights, stage carriage permits or loom hours is in the case of acquisition of
such asset by the assessee by purchase from a previous owner, cost of acquisition means the amount
of the purchase price; and in any other case cost of acquisition shall be Nil.
– Cost of improvement means all capital expenditure in making any additions or alterations
by the assessee after it became his property and where the capital asset became the property
of the assessee by any of the modes specified in Section 49(1) by the previous owner as the case may
be.
– Under Sections 54, 54B, 54D, 54EC, 54F, 54G and 54H of the Act, capital gains arising from the
transfer of certain capital assets are exempt from tax under certain circumstances.

LESSON OUTLINE

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

– Income chargeable under the head

Income chargeable under Income-tax Act, which
does not specifically fall for assessment under
any of the heads discussed earlier, must be
charged to tax as “income from other sources”.
This head is thus a residuary head of income
under which income can be computed only after
deciding whether the particular item of income
is otherwise assessable under any of the first
four heads. In addition to the taxation of income
not covered by the other heads, Section 56(2)
specifically provides certain items of incomes
as being chargeable to tax under the head in
every case. The provisions for computation of
income from other sources are covered under
sections 56 to 59. While section 56 defines the
scope of income chargeable under this head,
sections 57 and 58 specify the basis of
computation of such income.

‘Income from other Sources’
– Taxation of Casual Income
– Income from machinery, plant, or furniture
on hire
– Income from family pension
– Taxation of Dividends
– Deductions allowable in computing
income from other sources
– Amounts not Deductible (Section 58)
– Interest on Securities Section 56(2)
– Tax Concessions.
– Lesson Round Up
– Self Test Questions

At the end of this lesson, you will learn (i) which
are the income chargeable under the head
income from other sources, (ii) which are the
incomes specifically taxable under this head,
(iii) what are admissible deductions, (iv) which
are the inadmissible deductions and (v) what
are the provisions of taxability of gift in kind or
in cash from relative or unrelated persons.

The incomes which are neither covered under the head salary, house property, business income or
capital gains shall be taxable under head Income from other sources. This head of income is a residual
head because it covers all other incomes which are uncovered and which are not exempt from tax.

Further, under the provisions of Section 60 to 65 an assessee may be chargeable to tax in respect of income
arising to other persons, e.g. spouse or minor children. In such cases, the income in question will be first computed
under the appropriate head after allowing various deductions and includible in the total income of the assessee
under the head “income from other sources”. In other words, wherever the assessee is taxable in respect of
income of some body else, the income must be charged to tax in the hands of the assessee only under this head
even if the income is of a character which would otherwise fall for assessment under any other head of income.

TAXATION OF CASUAL INCOME [SECTION 56(2)(ib)]
Casual income includes income by way of winnings from lotteries; crossword puzzles; races including horse
races; gambling and betting of any nature or form; card games, game show or entertainment program on
television or electronic mode and any other game of any sort. All these incomes are chargeable to tax under the
head income from other sources. However, following income are not chargeable under the head “income from
other sources”:
(a) Lottery held at stock in trade: winning from lottery to an agent or trader out of its unsold stock of lottery
tickets shall be treated as incidental to business and taxed under the head “profit and gains of business
or profession “.
(b) Income of jockey: income of jockey from such profession is not treated as winning from the horse races.
(c) Winning from a motor car rally: winning from a motor car rally is a return for skill and effort and cannot be
created as casual income, these are taxable as normal income.

Deduction from Casual Income
No deduction or exemption is provided in respect of the casual income. [Section 58 (4)]. No deduction can be
claimed from such income even if such expenditure is incurred exclusively and wholly for earning such income.
Further, deduction under section 80C to 80U is also not available from such income.

Taxation of Casual Income
Casual income is liable to TDS. The casual icome is taxed at a flat rate of 30% plus surcharge (if any, plus
education cess plus secondary and higher education cess). When the TDS has already been deducted from the
income, then in order to calculate the tax liability on such income, the income is to be grossed up. [Section
115BB]
Example:
Lottery income received by Ram is Rs 70,000. Tax deducted at source is @ 30% of the income. Then the
grossed up amount will be Rs. 1,00,000.
Lottery income received= Gross lottery income- TDS@30% on gross lottery income.
Lottery income received = 70% of gross lottery income
Gross lottery income =

lottery income received
70%

However, the following incomes are not liable to TDS:
(1) Winning from lottery upto amount `10,000

324 EP-TL&P
(2) Winning from racing other than horse race
(3) Winning from horse race upto Rs. 5000

INCOME FROM MACHINERY, PLANT OR FURNITURE LET ON HIRE
Income from letting of machinery, plant or furniture is taxable under the head income from other sources, provided
such income is not of the following nature:
(a) Income from letting out an asset as a part of commercial or business activity
(b) Rent received from leasing out the business assets due to temporary discontinuance of business. Provided
the intention is not to part with the asset or close business.
(c) Any other income chargeable under head “Profits and gains of business or profession”
Further, if any machinery, plant or furniture is let out along with the building and the income from letting of
building is inseparable from the income from letting of machinery, plant or furniture, then the whole of such
income is chargeable under the head income from other sources.

INCOME FROM FAMILY PENSION
Family pension is a regular amount payable by the employer to a family member of a deceased employee. It is
taxable under the head income from other sources. The income by way of family pension is eligible for a standard
deduction under section 57(iia) which is either 1/3rd of such pension or Rs. 15000 whichever is lower.
Family pension received by the widow or children or nominated heirs, as the case may be, of a member of the
armed forces (including paramilitary forces) of the Union, where the death of such member has occurred in the
course of operational duties, in such circumstances and subject to such conditions, as may be prescribed, shall
be exempt from tax. Further, income by way of family pension received as family pension of an individual who
has been in the service of Central/State Government and has been awarded Param Vir Chakra or Maha Vir
Chakra or Vir Chakra or such other gallantry award as may be notified is also exempt from tax.

TAXATION OF DIVIDENDS
Section 10(34) exempts dividend as defined in Section 115-O from tax in the hands of recipients thereof.
Section 115-O, the main operative provision in the Chapter XII-D, however, calls upon a company declaring/
distributing dividend to pay 15% plus surcharge plus Education & Secondary and Higher Education Cess
by way of tax on distributed profits in addition to what it is liable by way of tax on its income in the normal
course. This tax on distribution paid by a company is not available for deduction under any provision of the
Act. Dividend for the purpose of Section 115-O and by extension for the purpose of Section 10(33) is the
same as defined in Section 2(22) except that clause (e) thereof shall not be treated as dividend for both
these purposes. Sub section (1B) inserted vide Finance Act, 2014 provides for grossing up the dividend for
computing the tax liability on account of dividend distribution tax. With the grossing up, the effective tax rate
will be 20.356% instead of 16.995%. In other words the scheme of taxation of dividend can be summarised
as under:
(a) Dividends or any other income distributed by UTI or a foreign company, are chargeable to tax under this
head.
(b) In respect of dividend under clause (e) of Section 2(22) the status quo continues i.e. the specified
persons receiving loans and advances from a closely-held company will continue to pay tax as
earlier on these receipts and the company giving such loans and advances will not be liable to tax
like it was earlier. It may be pointed out that tax liability under clause (e) of Section 2(22) would be
extremely unlikely now that there is no need for the dominant shareholders of closely-held companies
to combine dividend with the character of loan or advance to avoid tax liability because dividend is

Lesson 4

Part V – Income from Other Sources

325

no longer taxable in the hands of shareholders. Against this backdrop, the discussion hereunder
may be studied.

RATIONALIZATION OF TAXATION OF INCOME BY WAY OF DIVIDEND – SECTION 115BBDA
Under the existing provisions of clause (34) of section 10 of the Act, dividend which suffer dividend distribution
tax (DDT) under section 115-O is exempt in the hands of the shareholder. Under section 115-O dividends are
taxed only at the rate of fifteen percent at the time of distribution in the hands of company declaring dividends.
This creates vertical inequity amongst the tax payers as those who have high dividend income are subjected to
tax only at the rate of 15% whereas such income in their hands would have been chargeable to tax at the rate of
30%.
With a view to rationalise the tax treatment provided to income by way of dividend, it is provided by amending the
section of the Income-tax Act that any income by way of dividend in aggregate exceeding Rs. 10 lakh shall be
chargeable to tax in the case of an individual, Hindu undivided family (HUF) or a firm who is resident in India, at
the rate of 10% (+SC+EC+SHEC). The taxation of dividend income in aggregate exceding ten lakh rupees shall
be on gross basis. However, this rule is not applicable in case of deemed dividend under section 2(22)(e) (w.e.f.
1st April, 2016).

Meaning of the term ‘Dividend’ [Section 2(22)]
The term ‘dividend’ is ordinarily used to refer to any distribution made by a company to its shareholders out of its
profits in proportion to the number of shares held by the shareholder concerned in the company. Apart from the
distribution made by the company, any division of profit between the members who earned the same would also
be treated as dividend under the general meaning of expression. For purposes of income-tax, the definition of
dividend is given in Section 2(22) of the Income-tax Act. The definition, although not exhaustive and
comprehensive, is having the effect of over-riding anything else to the contrary contained in any other law for the
time being in force. The definition given in the Income-tax Act is enumerative and inclusive in nature and does
not precisely specify as to what exactly is meant by the term dividend. Consequently, any money received by a
shareholder which may not fall within the various items specified in the Income-tax Act may still be considered
and taxable as dividend except in cases where a different interpretation or inference could be had in the
circumstances of the case.
According to the definition in the Income-tax Act, ‘Dividend’ includes the following items:
(a) Any distribution by a company of accumulated profits, whether capitalised or not, if such
distribution entails the release by the company to its shareholders of all or any part of the assets of the
company;
Current profit would be part of accumulated profits but subsidy on Captal Account cannot be treated as
accumulated profts. – CIT v. Rajasthan Wires (P) Ltd. (2003) 130 Taxman 93 DP (Mag.).
(b) Any distribution, by a company to its shareholders, of debentures debenture stock or deposit
certificates in any form, whether with or without interest and any distribution to its preference
shareholders of shares by way of bonus to the extent to which the company possesses accumulated
profits, whether capitalised or not;
(c) Any distribution made to the shareholders of a company on its liquidation, to the extent to which
such distribution is attributable to the accumulated profits of the company immediately before its liquidation,
whether capitalized or not;
(d) Any distribution to its shareholders by a company on the reduction of its share capital, to the
extent to which the company possesses accumulated profits, whether capitalised or not;
(e) Any payment made by a company, in which the public are not substantially interested of any sum

326 EP-TL&P
whether representing a part of the assets of the company or otherwise made after the 31st day of May,
1987, by way of advance or loan to a shareholder, being a person who is the beneficial owner of shares
(not being shares entitled to a fixed rate of dividend whether with or without right to participate in profits),
holding not less than ten per cent of the voting power, or to any concern in which such shareholder is a
member or a partner and in which he has a substantial interest (hereinafter in this clause referred to as
the said concern), or any payment by any such company on behalf of or for the benefit of the shareholder
having substantial interest in the company to the extent to which the company possesses accumulated
profits.
But, Sub-section (22) to Section 2 specifically excludes the following:
(i) Any distribution made by a company in accordance with (c) or (d) above in respect of any share issued
for full cash consideration in cases where the shareholder is not entitled, in the event of liquidation, to
participate in the surplus assets of the company;
(ii) Any distribution made in accordance with items (c) and (d) above in so far the distribution is attributable
to the capitalised profits of the company representing bonus shares alloted to its equity shareholders
after 31.3.1964 and before 1.4.1965;
(iii) Any advance or loan made by a company to its shareholder the said concern, i.e, a HUF firm, an AOP
or, BOI or a company in the ordinary course of its business in cases where lending of money is a
substantial part of the business of the company;
(iv) Any dividend paid by a company which is set off by the company against the whole or any part of any
sum previously paid by it and treated as a dividend under item (e) above to the extent to which it is so set
off;
(v) Any payment made by a company on purchase of its own shares from a shareholder in accordance with
the provisions of Section 77A of the Companies Act, 1956;
(vi) Any distribution of shares pursuant to a demerger by the resulting company to the shareholders of the
demerged company (whether or not there is a reduction of capital in the demerged company).
The enumeration given above represents various payments which are notionally or by fiction of law, treated as
dividend and which, in the absence of specific provision may not be chargeable to tax as dividend income in the
hands of shareholders. The distributions or payments constituting dividend referred to above apply only to
payments or distributions made by a company as defined in Section 2(17) of the Income-tax Act.
Since the meaning and scope of the term ‘dividend’ used in the income-tax Act is much wider than what is
commonly understood, it covers not only payments as dividends made by a company in accordance with the
provisions of company law but also various other payments which may not amount to dividend under company
law. In order to be chargeable to tax as dividend, it is not essential that the dividend must be paid only in cash
although the provisions of Company Law require that a dividend must always be paid in cash or by cheque. In all
cases where a dividend is paid in any form other than cash, say in the form of goods, securities or shares, even
of another company, the amount of dividend which is liable to income-tax must be taken to be the market value
of the thing received as dividend.
For instance, if ‘A’ company distributes dividends to its shareholders in the form of shares of its wholly owned
subsidiary company ‘B’ at the face value of ` 100 each while the market value is ` 150 per share, the liability to tax
on the part of the company would be on the basis of the market value of the share. For this purpose, it is immaterial
if the shares are such that a part of the shares cannot be divided for being utilized towards tax deductible at source.
The company’s liabiltiy to pay distribution tax is not in any way affected or reduced by the fact that the dividend in
question is paid in kind or is calculated on a basis different from what the income-tax law provides.
It is likely that the company may not comply with some of the provisions of Company Law in the matter of

Lesson 4

Part V – Income from Other Sources

327

declaration and payment of dividends. Even in such cases, non-observance of the various formalities or the
provisions of Company Law by the company concerned would not in any way affect the taxability of the amount
as dividend in the hands of the Company. Consequently, if a company, in violation of law, distributes dividends
out of its share premium account, the Company would still be taxable regardless of the fact that the payment in
question does not come out of the revenue profits of the declaring company.
In the process of capitalisation of the accumulated profits and reserves, a company may normally resort to the
issue of bonus shares. This is mostly done in cases when a company is prosperous and has a large surplus and
after some time it is decided to convert the surplus into capital and divide the capital amongst the members in
proportion to their rights. This is done by issuing fully paid shares representing the increased share capital.
Bonus shares are issued out of credit balance to the Profit and Loss Account and out of reserves and the
shareholders to whom the shares are issued, have to pay nothing. The purpose is to capitalise profits which may
be otherwise available for distribution. If the Articles of Association of a company permit, a company can capitalise
profits and reserves and issue fully paid shares on a nominal value equal to the amount capitalised to its
shareholders. This is permissible subject, however, to the provisions of Sections 78 and 205 of the Companies
Act and guidelines issued in this regard by the SEBI.
When bonus shares are issued by a company to its equity shareholders the company is not chargeable to
distribution tax on the value of the bonus shares. This is because of the fact that according to Section 2(22)(a),
the distribution of accumulated profits of a company would result in dividend only if there is release of the
company’s assets as a result of such distribution. This is because of the fact that the effect of the bonus issue is
that the profits remain in the hands of the company as capital and the shareholders receive only paper certificates
as evidence of their interest in the additional capital so set aside or capitalised. The transaction takes nothing
out of the company’s coffers and puts nothing into the shareholders’ pockets and the only result is that the
company which, before the resolution, could have distributed the profits by way of dividend or carried it to a
reserve account, comes under an obligation to retain it permanently as its capital. Therefore, bonus shares
given by a company in proportion to the holding of equity capital by a shareholder are, in the absence of any
express provision to the contrary, not liable to be taxed as income. Therefore, bonus shares are not dividend or
income at all when they are issued to the holders of equity or ordinary shares.
However, the utilisation of the accumulated profits for the purpose of starting a subsidiary company and issue of
shares of the subsidiary company to its own shareholders as bonus shares would constitute dividend, as there
would be a release of assets by the parent company.
In cases where bonus shares are issued to the holders of preference shares, the market value of the bonus
shares would be liable to distribution tax as income by way of dividends in the hands of the Company in view of
the specific provisions contained in Section 2(22)(b). However, even in the case of preference shreholders, the
liability to tax would be only to the extent to which the distribution is made by the company out of its accumulated
profits, whether capitalised or not.
Any distribution made by a company out of its accumulated profits would constitute dividend if the distribution is
made on the reduction of share capital of the company. This reduction may take place even in cases where
bonus shares are issued by capitalising the accumulated profits and reserves of the company and later on
paying off the bonus shares. This may also take place in cases where the accumulated profits are applied first
towards making the partly-paid shares into fully-paid ones and later, the amount of the fully-paid shares is
reduced on reduction of share capital. Even in the case of liquidation of a company, any distribution made by the
liquidator (less than the capital subscribed) would constitute income from dividend to the extent to which the
distribution could be attributable to the accumulated profits of the company which may or may not have been
capitalised during the existence of the company.
The ‘accumulated profits’ for the purpose do not include any capital gain arising to the company before 1.4.1946
or after 31.3.1948 and before 1.4.1956 because during these periods capital gains were not chargeable to tax
and were consequently not treated as part of the profits of the company. In the case of every company, the

328 EP-TL&P
expression accumulated profits must be taken to include all profits of the company upto the date of distribution
or payment including reserves kept for specific purposes so long as such reserves constitute an appropriation of
profit instead of being a charge against profit. For instance, amount represented by the balance to the credit of
the development rebate reserves account would form part of the accumulated profits of the company; but if a
company follows the process of crediting the amount of depreciation reserve account such a reserve would not
form part of the accumulated profits of the company because depreciation is a charge against the profits and not
an appropriation of profits. In the case of a company in liquidation, accumulated profits should be taken to
include all the profits of the company upto the date of liquidation. But in cases where the liquidation is consequent
upon the compulsory acquisition of its undertaking by a government or a corporation owned or controlled by the
government under any law for the time being in force, accumulated profits should not be taken to include any
profits of the company prior to three successive accounting years immediately preceeding the accounting year
in which such acquisition of the company was made by the government or other statutory corporation.
Any payment of loan or other advance by a company, in which the public are not substantially interested, to its
shareholder who has substantial interest in the company would constitute dividend to the extent to which the
company possesses accumulated profits which may or may not have been capitalised. Similarly, any payment
made by a closely held company for the individual benefit of a shareholder who has a substantial interest in the
company would also constitute dividend chargeable to tax in the hands of the shareholder. For instance, if a
closely held company makes payment of insurance premium on behalf of the shareholder or lends money to the
shareholder or makes any advance on his behalf, the shareholder would be deemed to have received a dividend
and be chargeable to income-tax thereon. The expression ‘shareholder’ for this purpose should be taken to
mean only the registered shareholder and not the beneficial shareholder. Consequently in cases where the
loans are given by a closely held company to a Hindu Undivided Family of which the registered shareholder is
a member, such loans would not be taxable as dividend since the Hindu Undivided Family is not registerable as
shareholder of the company. If, however, the loans are advanced to the registered shareholders, the loans
would be taxable as dividend even though the registered shareholder may not have any personal or beneficial
interest in the shares conerned. The liability to tax in respect of such loans, advances, other payments made by
a closely held company to its substantial shareholder, would be only to the extent to which the company possesses
accumulated profits, which may or may not have been capitalised.
In the case of CIT v. V. Damodaran (1980) 121 ITR 572, the Supreme Court held that ‘accumulated profits’
cannot include current profits, and therefore, the profits earned by the company during the year in which loans
are advanced to a shareholder cannot be regarded as accumulated profits for deemed dividends. Therefore, if
the company at the time of giving the loan or making the advance does not have any accumulated profit, there
would be no liability to tax because of the specific exemption given in the section. Similarly, any loan by a closely
held company to its substantial shareholder which is set off against any loan or money borrowed by or due to the
company from the shareholder would also be not liable to income-tax as dividend. In cases where a company
possesses accumulated profits and loans are given to the shareholder, the liability to tax on the part of the
shareholder would not be restricted to the amount of the accumulated profits in proportion to his shareholding in
the company. Thus, if a company has accumulated profits of `1,00,000 and a shareholder holding 20% of the
equity shares is given a loan of `80,000, the shareholder cannot claim that his liability to tax would by only to the
extent of ` 20,000, he would be taxable on the entire amount of loan received from the company although if the
company had declared dividend at an Annual General Meeting, he would have been entitled to receive a maximum
of ` 20,000 only.

Part V – Income from Other Sources

329

DEDUCTIONS ALLOWABLE IN COMPUTING INCOME FROM OTHER SOURCES
The income chargeable under the head “Income from other sources” is the income after making the following
deductions:
1. From interest on securities [Section 57(i) and (iii)]: any reasonable sum paid by way of commission or
remuneration to a banker or any other person for the purpose of realising such interest on behalf of the assessee.
Interest on money borrowed for investment in securities can be claimed as a deduction.
During the previous year the assessee withdrew a fixed deposit before maturity and had to refund ` 3,500 to the
bank. The amount withdrawn was invested in shares. It was held by Karnataka High Court under the earlier
regime that the amount paid to the Bank was an expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of
earning the dividend income and deduction thereof while computing income from dividend is in order. C.I.T. v.
Master Sabraya M. Pai (1984) 150 ITR 251 (Kar.).
2. From the contributions received by employer from employees towards P.F./Superannuation/other funds:
[Section 57(ia)]
In the case of income of the nature referred to in Section 2(24)(x), which is chargeable to income-tax under the
head “Income form other sources” deduction shall be allowable in accordance with the provisions of Section
36(1)(va), i.e., if the employer has credited the employee’s accounts in the respective funds with the amounts of
contributions received, the employer shall be allowed credit thereof.
3. Income derived from letting [Section 57(ii)]: Where income is derived from letting out of machinery, plant
or furniture on hire and also buildings where the letting of building is inseparable from the letting of such machinery,
plant or furniture and the income from such letting is not chargeable to Income-tax under the head “Profits and
Gains of Business or profession”, the following expenses incurred in respect of those assets:
(a) Current repairs of buildings.
(b) Insurance premium against risk of damage or destruction of the premises.
(c) Repairs and insurance of machinery, plant or furniture.
(d) Depreciation.
Where the expenses referred to at (a) to (d) hereinabove are incurred on property used partly for the business
of the assessee, a proportionate deduction shall be allowed.
4. Income in the nature of family pension [Section 57(iia)]: Where a regular monthly amount is payable by an
employer to a person belonging to the family of an employee in the event of his death, i.e., ‘family pension’, a
sum equal to 33-1/3% of the income or ` 15,000, whichever is less, is allowable as a deduction.
All these expenses will be allowed only when the prescribed particulars are furnished by the assessee.
5. Interest on compensation or enhanced compensation [Section 56(2)(viii)]: a deduction of a sum equal to
50% of such income and no deduction shall be allowed under any other clause of this section.
6. Other deductions [Section 57(iii)]: Any other expenditure (not being in the nature of capital expenditure)
laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of making or earning such income. [Smt. Virmati
Ramkrishna v. C.I.T. (1981) 131 ITR 659(Guj)]

Conditions to be satisfied for claiming deductions
Deductions under this clause will, therefore, be allowed only if the following conditions are satisfied:
(a) The expenditure is laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of earning such income. If the purpose of
earning income is coupled with some other extraneous purpose, it will not be possible to say that the deduction
under Section 57 (iii) is earned by the assessee. [Smt. Padmavati Jaykrishna v. C.I.T. (1975) 101 ITR 153].

330 EP-TL&P
(b) It is not in the nature of capital expenditure.
(c) It is not a personal expenditure.
(d) It is incurred in the accounting year itself and not in any prior or subsequent year. [C.I.T. v. Basant Rai
Takhat Singh (1922) ITR 197].
The section does not say that the expenditure shall be deductible only if income is made or earned. Interest on
moneys borrowed for investment in shares which had not yielded any income was admissible as a deduction
under the section. [C.I.T. v. Gopal (1978) 111 ITR 86].
Note: In computing the income by way of dividends of a foreign company, no deduction will be allowed under
Section 57.

AMOUNTS NOT DEDUCTIBLE (SECTION 58)
The following amounts shall not be deducted in computing income chargeable under the head ‘Income from
other sources’:
In the case of any assessee:
(i) Any personal expenses of the assessee.
(ii) Any interest chargeable under the Income-tax Act which is payable outside India and from which incometax has not been paid or deducted at source.
(iii) Any payment which is chargeable under the head “Salaries” if it is payable outside India unless tax has
been paid thereon or deducted therefrom at source.
(iv) Any expenditure referred to in Section 40A of Income-tax Act.
Section 58(3) lays down that in the case of a foreign company, the provisions of Section 44D will apply while
computing income under this head.
No deduction is allowed in respect of any expenditure or allowance in computing the income by way of
winnings from lotteries crossword puzzles races (including horse races) card games and other games of any
sort or from gambling or betting of any form or nature whatsoever. The prohibition however will not apply in
respect of income of an assessee who is owner of horses maintained for running in horse races [Section
58(4)]. The winnings are now taxed at the rate of 30%. The amount is taxable at source and it does not matter
whether amount goes to one or more recipients. Similarly the amount spent in buying of in fructuous tickets
is not deductible as the gross amount will be taxed.

TAX CONCESSIONS
The word “security” has not been defined by the Income-tax Act. Therefore, its natural meaning as well as the
meaning, as interpreted in the case laws, has to be adopted.
The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines “security” as : “a document held by a creditor as guarantee of his
right to payment. This implies that unless the payment of debt is secured in some way, a mere ”debt” is not a
security.
In Singer v. Williams (1921) 1 AC 41, Lord Cave pointed out that the word “security” denotes a debt or claim,
the payment of which is in some way secured. Where the word is used in its normal sense, some form of
secured liability is postulated. The word “securities” must be construed in the above defined sense and does not
include shares or stock in a company”.

Lesson 5
Income of Other Persons Included in
Assessee’s Total Income and Set-Off or
Carry Forward of Losses
LESSON OUTLINE

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

– Clubbing of Income

In addition to the general provisions which are
applicable for computation of total income, there
are special provisions in Sections 60 to 65 of
the Income-tax Act which provide for inclusion
of income of other persons in the total income
of assessee. The special provisions contained
in these sections are designed to counteract the
various attempts of an individual for avoiding or
reducing his liability to tax by transferring his
assets or income to other person(s) while, at
the same time, retaining certain powers or
interest over the property or it’s income. These
provisions may also be termed as clubbing
provisions.

– Transfer of Income (Section 60)
– Revocable Transfer of Assets (Section
61)
– Transfer irrevocable for a specified
period (Section 62)
– Income of Spouse
– Income to son’s wife [Section
64(1)(vi)]

In the second part of this lesson provisions for
set-off and carry forward of losses are
discussed. Sometimes the assessee incurs a
loss from a source of income and unless such
loss is set-off against any income, the net result
of the assessee’s activities during the particular
accounting year cannot be ascertained and
consequently the tax payable would also be
incapable of determination. For this purpose,
the Income-tax Act contains specific provisions
(Sections 70 to 80) for the set-off and carryforward of losses.

– Transfer for immediate or deferred
benefit of Son’s W ife [Section
64(1)(viii)]
– Income to Spouse through a Third
Person [Section 64(1)(vii)]
– Clubbing of income of minor child
[Section 64(1A)]
– Income from the converted property
[Section 64(2)]

At the end of this lesson, you will learn

– Set-off and Carry-forward of Losses

– When are clubbing provisions applicable

– Carry forward of losses

– What are the provisions of set off/carry
forward and set off of losses

– Treatment of carry-forward of losses of
certain assessees

– How can losses be set off inter-head and
intra-head.

– Submission of Section of Loss

CLUBBING OF INCOME
In addition to the general provisions which are applicable to the assessment of tax-payers and the computation
of their total income, there are special provisions in the Income-tax Act which lay down the method of computing
the total income of an individual for income-tax purposes. In particular, Sections 60 to 65 of the Income-tax Act
provide that in computing the total income of an individual for purposes of assessment, there shall be included
all the items of income specified in these sections. The special provisions contained in these sections are
designed to counteract the various attempts which an individual may make for avoiding or reducing his liability
to tax by transferring his assets or income to other person(s) while, at the same time, retaining certain powers or
interest over the property or it’s income. These provisions are explained below.

TRANSFER OF INCOME (SECTION 60)
Section 60 of Income Tax Act, 1961 provides the provisions relating to clubbing of income where transfer of
income is done without transferring the assets.
Where a person transfers to any other person, income (whether revocable or not) from an asset without transferring
that asset, the income shall be included in the total income of the transferor. “Transfer” includes any settlement,
trust, covenant, agreement or arrangement. The transfer also includes a lease for inadequate consideration and
the income derived by the lessee from the leased property is included in the income of the lessor.
These are applicable if the following conditions are satisfied:
a) The taxpayer owns an asset
b) The ownership of asset is not transferred by him.
c) The income from the asset is transferred to any person under a settlement, or agreement.
If the above conditions are satisfied, the income from the asset would be taxable in the hands of the transferor
If the transferor transfers the asset and keeps the income for himself, the income shall be included in the income
of transferor.
Section 60 of the Act has no application where assets producing income are transferred along with the income
C.I.T. v. Ram Prasad Mehta (1975) 100 ITR 468 (Bombay). There may be a field of operation of Sections 61 to
64 but certainly not of Section 60.
Illustration : A owns Debentures worth Rs 1,000,000 of ABC Ltd., (annual) interest being Rs. 100,000. On April
1, 2017, he transfers interest income to B, his friend without transferring the ownership of these debentures.
In this particular case during 2016-17, interest of Rs. 100,000 is received by B; it will be taxable in the hands of
A as per Section 60.

REVOCABLE TRANSFER OF ASSETS (SECTION 61)
Where a person transfers any asset to any person with a right to revoke the transfer, all income accruing to the
transferee from the asset shall be included in the total income of the transferor.
The income under revocable transfer of asset shall be included in the income of transferor even when only a
part of income from transferred asset has been applied for the transferor.
For this purpose assets include movable or immovable property whether situated in India or abroad.
As per Section 63, a transfer shall be deemed to be revocable if:
(i) it contains any provision for the re-transfer directly or indirectly of the whole or any part of the income or
assets to the transferor; or

Lesson 5 Income of Other Persons Included in Assessee’s Total Income and Set-Off or Carry Forward of Losses 341
(ii) it, in any way, gives the transferor a right to reassume power directly, or indirectly over the whole or any
part of the income or assets.
Examples of revocable transfers
Some of the examples of revocable transfers are as follows:
(i) If there is an express clause of revocation in the instrument of transfer; or
(ii) If there is a sale with a condition of re-purchase; or
(iii) If the transfer is to a trust and if the transfer can be revoked with the consent of two or more beneficiaries;
or
(iv) If the trustees are empowered in sole discretion to revoke the transfer; or
(v) If the transferor has power to change beneficiary or trustees.
“Transfer” includes any settlement, trust, covenant, agreement or arrangement.
However, re-transfer to the transferor must be in the same capacity in which he made the transfer or settlement.
If a settlement is made by a Hindu undivided family and there is a re-transfer to one member of the family in his
capacity as an individual and not in his capacity as a member of the family this cannot be termed a re-transfer for
this purpose.

INCOME OF SPOUSE
The following incomes of husband and wife are clubbed:
(a) Income to spouse from a concern in which such individual has substantial interest [Section 64(1)(ii)]
All such income as arises directly or indirectly, to the spouse of an individual by way of salary, commission, fees
or any other remuneration, whether in cash or kind from a concern in which such individual has a substantial
interest, shall be included in the income of the individual. However, where the spouse possesses technical or
professional qualifications and the income is solely attributable to the application of his/her technical or professional
knowledge and experience, the income shall not be included in the income of (other spouse) the assessee.
An individual shall be deemed to have a substantial interest in a concern –
(i) In a case where the concern is a company, if its shares (not being shares entitled to a fixed rate of
dividend whether with or without a further right to participate in profits) carrying not less than 20% of the
voting power are, at any time during the previous year, owned beneficially by such person or partly by
such person and partly by one or more of his relatives;
(ii) In any other case, if such person is entitled, or such person and one or more of his relatives are entitled
in the aggregate, at any time during the previous year, to not less than 20% of the profits of such
concern.
Where the individual is not entitled to receive any profit of the concern from which the spouse receives salary,
commission, fees or other remuneration, such income shall not be included in the income of such individual and
the spouse shall be assessable for this income.
Where both husband and wife have a substantial interest in the concern and both are in receipt of the remuneration
in such concern, the remuneration from such concern is to be included in the total income of the husband or,
as the case may be, the wife whose total income excluding the income referred to in that clause i.e. 64(1)(ii) is
greater; (Circular No. 258, dated 14-6-79) and where any such income is once included in the total income of
either spouse, any such income arising in any succeeding year shall not be included in the total income of the
other spouse unless the Assessing Officer is satisfied, after giving that spouse an opportunity of being heard,
that it is necessary so to do.

342 EP-TL&P
Illustration
Mr. P is employed as Public Relation Officer in a company where Mrs. P holds 21 per cent equity
shares. She has been holding the share before marriage with Mr. P., Mr. P gets a salary of ` 1,500 per
month.
The whole salary of ` 18,000 will be included in the income of Mrs. P provided Mr. P has no technical or
professional qualification. It is immaterial that the remuneration so paid is genuine and not excessive and
that Mrs. P had substantial interest in the company even before her marriage.
(b) Income to spouse from the assets transferred [Section 64(1)(iv)]
Where any individual transfers directly or indirectly any asset (other than a house property) to the spouse, the
income from such asset shall be included in the income of the transferor.
In order to attract the provisions of this section, it is not necessary that the asset must have been transferred by
the assessee to his spouse in the same form in which it stands at the time the income arises. Conversion of
assets from one form to another would be totally immaterial and it is also not essential that the transfer must
have taken place directly between the spouses. However, there are exceptions to this rule:
(i) The transferor has received adequate consideration in money or money’s worth. If the consideration
was inadequate, proportionate income shall be included in the income of the transferor.
(ii) The transfer has been made in connection with an agreement to live apart. This separation can be
either judicial or voluntary under circumstances in which a judicial separation can be granted.
(iii) The income from the assets transferred shall not be included in the income of transferor after the death
of spouse, either transferor or transferee.
(iv) The income from assets transferred shall be included in the income of the transferor, only if the relationship
as spouse exists on the two dates, i.e., the date of transfer and the date on which the income accrues
or arises to the transferee. If any asset has been transferred before marriage, the income from such
asset cannot be included in the income of the transferor.
(v) Only the direct income (including capital gains) earned with the help of the transferred assets shall be
included in the income of the transferor. Any indirect income to the transferee from the transferred
assets shall not be included in the income of the transferor.
Suppose, A transfers certain shares to his wife B. Dividends received on such shares are taxable in the hands
of A. If B sells the shares and makes some capital gains, such gains are also taxable in A’s hands. Now from the
dividend money, B purchases some more shares and receives dividends on these new shares, such dividends
are not taxable to A. In the same way, if B receives certain bonus shares on the shares transferred by her
husband and later on she receives dividend on such bonus shares, the dividend shall not be included in the
income of the transferor because the bonus shares were never transferred by her husband.
If some pin-money is given to wife by her husband neither the savings out of pin-money nor the income earned
with the help of savings out of pin-money can be included in the income of husband.

INCOME TO SON’S WIFE [SECTION 64(1)(vi)]
Where any individual transfers, directly or indirectly, any asset to his/her son’s wife without adequate consideration,
after 1.6.1973, the income from such asset shall be included in the income of the transferor.

TRANSFER FOR IMMEDIATE OR DEFERRED BENEFIT OF SON’S WIFE [SECTION 64(1)(viii)]
Any income arising, directly or indirectly, to any person or association of persons from assets transferred directly

Lesson 5 Income of Other Persons Included in Assessee’s Total Income and Set-Off or Carry Forward of Losses 343
or indirectly after June 1, 1973, otherwise than for adequate consideration to the person or association of
persons by such individual shall, to the extent to which the income from such assets is for the immediate or
deferred benefit of his son’s wife be included in computing the total income of such individual.
Explanation: For the purpose of clauses (iv) and (vi), where the assets transferred directly or indirectly by an
individual to his spouse or son’s wife (hereafter in this Explanation referred to as “the transferee”) are invested
by the transferee –
(i) in any business, such investment being not in the nature of contribution of capital as a partner in a firm
or, as the case may be, for being admitted to the benefits of partnership in a firm, that part of the income
arising out of the business to the transferee in any previous year, which bears the same proportion to
the income of the transferee from the business as the value of the assets aforesaid as on the first day of
the previous year bears to the total investment in the business by the transferee as on the said day;
(ii) in the nature of contribution of capital as a partner in a firm, that part of the interest receivable by the
transferee from the firm in any previous year, which bears the same proportion to the interest receivable
by the transferee from the firm as the value of investment aforesaid as on the first day of the previous
year bears to the total investment by way of capital contribution as a partner in the firm as on the said
day,
shall be included in the total income of the individual in that previous year.

INCOME TO SPOUSE THROUGH A THIRD PERSON [SECTION 64(1)(vii)]
Where a person transfers some assets directly or indirectly to a person or association of persons (trustee or
body of trustees or juristic person) without adequate consideration for the immediate or deferred benefit of his or
her spouse, all such income as arises directly or indirectly from assets transferred shall be included in the
income of the transferor. If only a portion is reserved for the benefit of spouse and a portion is utilised for the
benefit of others, only the portion reserved for the spouse shall be included in the income of the transferor.
The share of income of the spouse can be included in the income of the transferor provided the spouse has
either received the income or the income has accrued to spouse or the spouse has a beneficial interest in the
income. If an individual creates a life-interest in a property in favour of a third person and grants the remainder
to his spouse, and so long as the third person is alive, she should not be getting any benefit out of transferred
asset, such income cannot be included in the income of the transferor. If however, the benefit from the assets
transferred is to be derived by the transferor himself, the transfer would be treated as revocable and would
consequently fall within the purview of Section 61 which provides that the entire income arising from the assets
so transferred shall be included in the total income of the transferor.
Where a trust was created by assessee’s mother for the benefit of the assessee, his wife and the trustees were
authorised to carry on business, the income from the business was held to be income of the trust and the share
of wife could not be added to the income of the spouse because neither the trust was created by the assessee
nor the business done in the partnership. [K.T. Doctor v. C.I.T. (1980) 124 ITR 501 (Guj.)].

CLUBBING OF INCOME OF MINOR CHILD [SECTION 64(1A)]
All income which arises or accrues to the minor child (not being a minor child suffering from any disability of the
nature specified in Section 80U) shall be clubbed in the income of his parent. However, any income which is
derived by the minor from manual work or from any activity involving application of his skill, talent or specialised
knowledge and experience will not be included in the income of his parent. Further, the income of the minor
shall be included in the income of that parent whose total income excluding income includible under this subsection is greater, where the marriage of minor’s parents subsists, otherwise the income of the minor will be
includible in the income of that parent who maintains the minor child in the relevant previous year.

344 EP-TL&P
Once the income of the minor is included in the total income of any one parent, clubbing of income of the minor
with the same parent will continue in subsequent years also, unless the Assessing Officer is satisfied, after
giving that parent an opportunity of being heard that it is necessary so to do.
In case the income of an individual includes any income of his minor child in terms of this section [i.e. Section
64(1A)], such individual shall be entitled to exemption of the amount of such income or Rs. 1,500 whichever is
less.

INCOME FROM THE CONVERTED PROPERTY [SECTION 64(2)]
Where an individual, being a member of Hindu Undivided Family, transfers his self-acquired property after
31st December, 1969 to the family for the common benefit of the family, or throwing it into the common stock of
the family, or transfers it directly or indirectly to the family otherwise than for adequate consideration, such
property is known as converted property. The income derived from the converted property or any part thereof,
shall be included in the income of the transferor.
For this section “property” includes any interest in property, movable or immovable the proceeds of sale thereof
and any money or investment for the time being representing the proceeds of sale thereof and where the
property is converted into any other property by any method, such other property.
Income from converted property to spouse after partition
Where the converted property has been the subject matter of total or partial partition amongst the members of
the family, the income derived from such converted property as is received by the spouse of the transferor on
partition shall be included in the income of the individual.
The income so included in the total income of the individual shall be excluded from the total income of the
family or spouse, as the case may be.
The income from the above mentioned items shall first be computed under the appropriate heads in the hands
of the transferee and after that it shall be included in the total income of the transferor under the head, “Income
from other sources”. However, the income from house property transferred to spouse shall be computed under
the head ‘Income from house property’ in the hands of transferor and not in the hands of the transferee.
Explanation to the term ‘income’ used in Section 64 includes ‘loss’. This amendment nullifies the decision in
Dayalbhai Madhavji Vadera v. C.I.T. (1966) 60 ITR 551 of the Gujarat High Court that the term ‘income’ used in
Sub-section (1) of Section 64 does not include a loss.

RECOVERY OF TAX
Dual Liability for Tax: The tax on the income of the other person which has been included in the income of the
assessee can either be recovered from the assessee or from the other person. The liability of other person is
limited to the portion of the tax levied on the assessee which is attributable to the income so included. His
liability arises after the service of a notice of demand by the Assessing Officer in this behalf.
Where any such asset (the income from which has been included in that of the assessee) is held jointly by more
than one person, they shall be jointly and severally liable to pay the tax which is attributable to the income from
the assets so included.
Illustration
Mr Sharma invests Rs 10 lakh in a fixed deposit (FD) at a bank, in his wife’s name. Interest of Rs. 1 lakhs arises
on this income. Mrs Sharma invests the interest on periodic basis and interest for an amount of Rs. 5,000 arises
on the interest deposited by her in bank. Analyze the clubbing provisions and find out the taxability of interest
accrued.

Lesson 5 Income of Other Persons Included in Assessee’s Total Income and Set-Off or Carry Forward of Losses 345
Solution
Rs. 1 lakhs in the Now Interest income on FD will be clubbed with his (Mr. Sharma) income. Interest of Rs. 5,000
aroused out of Investment made by Mrs. Sharma will be taxed as her own income.

PART-II
SET-OFF AND CARRY-FORWARD OF LOSSES
While one endeavors to derive income, the possibility of incurring losses cannot be ruled out. Based on the
principles of natural justice, a set-off should be available for loss incurred. The income tax laws in India recognize
this and provide for adjustment and utilization of the losses. For this purpose, the Income-tax Act, 1961 contains
specific provisions (Sections 70 to 80) for the set-off and carry- forward of losses.
Income-tax is levied on the total income of the previous year of an assessee and it is necessary to ascertain the
total income. Further, loss incurred by the assessee is to be set-off against any income, the net result of the
assessee’s activities during the particular accounting year cannot be ascertained and consequently the tax
payable would also be incapable of determination.

SET-OFF OF LOSSES FROM ONE SOURCE AGAINST INCOME FROM ANOTHER SOURCE
UNDER THE SAME HEAD OF INCOME [SECTION 70]
The process of adjustment of loss from a source under a particular head of income against income from other
source under the same head of income is called intra-head adjustment, e.g. Adjustment of loss from business A
against profit from business B.
Income of a person is computed under five heads. ‘Sources’ of income derived by an individual may be many
but yet they could be classified under the same head. Consider a situation where Harish has two properties –
one, occupied by him and the other, let out. Harish pays interest on loan of Rs 1.50 lakh on the property
occupied and derives net rental income of Rs 1.50 lakh from the let-out property. In case of a self-occupied
property, income is computed as nil and interest expenditure results in loss. The loss of Rs 1.50 lakh can be set
off against rent income of Rs 1.50 lakh; the income chargeable under the head ‘House property’ will be ‘Nil’.

346 EP-TL&P
Thus, in general, if the net result for any assessment year in respect of any source falling under any head of
income is a loss, the assessee is entitled to set off the amount of such loss against his income from any other
source under the same head.
However, the following are the exceptions to general rule:
1. Loss from speculation business cannot be set of against profit from an non speculation business however
loss from non speculative business can be set-off against speculation income)
2. Long Term Capital Loss (LTCL) can only be set off against Long Term Capital Gain (LTCG) and cannot
be set off against Short term Capital Gain (STCG) however STCL can be set off against LTCG)
3. No loss can be set-off against casual income i.e. Income from lotteries, crossword puzzles, race
including horse race, card game, and any other game of any sort or from gambling or betting of any
form or nature.
4. No expenses can be claimed against casual income
5. Loss from the business of owning and maintaining race horses cannot be set off against any income
other than income from the business of owning and maintaining race horses.
6. Loss from an exempted source cannot be set off against taxable Income- If income from a particular
source is exempt from tax, then loss from such source cannot be set off against any other income which
is chargeable to tax. E.g., Agricultural income is exempt from tax, hence, if the taxpayer incurs loss from
agricultural activity, then such loss cannot be adjusted against any other taxable income.
7. Loss from business specified under section 35AD cannot be set off against any other income except
income from specified business (section 35AD is applicable in respect of certain specified businesses
like setting up a cold chain facility, setting up and operating warehousing facility for storage of agricultural
produce, developing and building a housing projects, etc.).
(A) Loss from business or profession
Any loss from business or profession (other than speculation business or loss from the activity of owning and
maintaining race horses) can be set off against the income from any other business or profession including
the income from speculation business or income from the activity of owning and maintaining race horses.
If any business has been discontinued during the year, the loss from such business can also be set-off from the
income of other business or profession.
The loss suffered by a wholly owned subsidiary company cannot be set-off by the parent company, since both
are separate assessees. Similarly, where loss incurred by a wholly owned subsidiary company is reimbursed by
the holding company, the subsidiary company does not use the right to carry forward and set-off the loss. [C.I.T.
v. Handicraft Handloom Export Corporation (1982) 133 ITR 590 (Delhi)].
(B) Loss from speculation business
Such loss can be set-off only against the income from speculation business. It is not essential that the nature of
the other speculation transaction must be the same. Speculative transactions in different commodities and in
different markets are to be treated as one business. However, a loss from an illegal speculation business cannot
be set-off against income from any lawful speculation. [C.I.T. v. K.J. Kotecha 107 ITR 101 (SC)]. Similarly, where
the assessee earns commission on speculative transactions, he is not entitled to set-off speculative loss against
such commission because there is no element of speculation in the commission [C.I.T. v. Pangal Vittal Nayak &
Co. Pvt. Ltd. (1969) 74 I.T.R. 754 (S.C.)]. By virtue of an explanation to Section 73 where any part of the
business of a company (other than a company whose gross total income consists mainly of income which is
chargeable under the heads: “Interest on securities”, “Income from House Property”, “Capital gains”, “Income
from other sources”, or a company the principal business of which is the business of banking or granting of loans

Lesson 5 Income of Other Persons Included in Assessee’s Total Income and Set-Off or Carry Forward of Losses 347
and advances) consists of the purchase and sale of shares of other companies, such company shall for the
purpose of this section (Section 73), be deemed to be carrying on a speculation business to the extent to which
the business consists of the purchase and sale of such shares.

Set-off of loss from one head against income from another head [Section 71]
After making intra-head adjustment (if any) the next step is to make inter-head adjustment. If in any year, the
taxpayer has incurred loss under one head of income and is having income under other head of income, then he
can adjust the loss from one head against income from other head, E.g., Loss under the head of house
property to be adjusted against salary income.
A person may have various sources of income computed under different heads of income. Loss under one head
of income is generally allowed to be set off against income under another head.
For instance, X has only one property, which is occupied by him and the loss is Rs 1.50 lakh. He derives salary
of Rs 10 lakh during the year. Here, he can set off the loss of Rs 1.50 lakh against his salary income by making
appropriate declarations to his employer, thereby making his net taxable income Rs 8.50 lakh.
The provision of Section 71 reads as under:
(a) an assessee not having any income under the head “Capital gains” and having loss from income under
other heads (excluding capital gains) can set off such loss against his income under any other head
(other than “capital gains”);
(b) loss under any head of income (other than “capital gains”) can be set off against income from any head
of income, including “capital gains”;
(c) loss under the head “capital gains” cannot be set off against income under any other head. It must be
set off only against income from “capital gains”.
(d) Loss under the head “Profits and gains of business or profession” cannot be set off against the head
“income from Salaries”.
(e) Where the assessee incurs any loss under the head income from house property it can be set off
against the assessee’s any other income under other head during the previous years where such loss
is not fully adjusted under other heads of income in the same assessment year, then the balance loss
shall be allowed to be carried forward and set off in subsequent years subject to a limit of eight assessment
years against income from house property.
(f) Loss incurred by an assessee from a source, income from which is exempt, cannot be set-off against
income from a taxable source.
There are certain exceptions to the general rule that Loss under one head of income is allowed to be set off
against income under another head.
a) Loss from speculative business cannot be set off against any other income. However, non-speculative
business loss can be set off against income from speculative business. For Example: House property
loss can be set-off against Speculative Incomes but speculation loss cannot be set off against House
property)
b) Business loss cannot be set-off against salary income. (It can be set-off against other incomes)
c) Loss under the head Capital Gains (LTCL or STCL) cannot be set-off against any other head however
Loss from other heads can be set-off against Capital Gains. For an instance, House Property loss can
be set-off against CG but LTCL or STCL cannot be set off against HP, i.e., house property Income.
d) No loss can be set off against Casual income such as winnings from lotteries, crossword puzzles, race

348 EP-TL&P
including horse race, card game, and any other game of any sort or from gambling or betting of any form
or nature.
e) No expenses can be claimed against casual income.
f) Loss from the business of owning and maintaining race horses cannot be set off against any other
income.
g) Loss from an exempted source cannot be set off (e.g. Share of loss of firm, agricultural income, cultivation
expenses)
h) Loss from business specified under section 35AD cannot be set off against any other income (section
35AD is applicable in respect of certain specified businesses like setting up a cold chain facility, setting
up and operating warehousing facility for storage of agricultural produce, developing and building housing
projects, etc.)
It may be noted that Before making inter-head adjustment, the taxpayer has to first make intra-head adjustment.

CARRY-FORWARD OF LOSSES
Many times it may happen that after making intra-head and inter-head adjustments, still the loss remains
unadjusted and if it is not possible to set-off the losses during the same assessment year in which these occurred,
so much of the loss as has not been so set-off, can be carried forward to the following assessment year and so
on. Losses can be set-off against the income of following years provided that they have been suffered by
assessee and determined in pursuance of a return filed by the asessee. Further, carry forward of losses (other
than loss from house property and unabsorbed depreciation) is permissible if the return of income for the year,
in which loss is incurred, is filed in time. The late filing of return should not impact the status of carry forward of
loss of previous years.
The following losses could be carried forward :
(i) Loss in non-speculation business or profession.
(ii) Loss in speculation business.
(iii) Loss in transfer of capital assets [whether short-term or long-term].
(iv) Loss from activity of owning and maintaining of race horses.
(v) Loss under the head ‘Income from House Property’ so far as it relates to interest on borrowed capital
referred to in Section 24(1)(vi). It is applicable up to assessment year 1996-97 only.
However, losses suffered under the following heads are not allowed to be carried forward and set off:
(1) Losses under the head ‘salaries’.
(2) Losses under the head ‘Income from other sources’ (excepting loss suffered from the activity of owning
and maintaining race horses).
(A) LOSS IN NON-SPECULATION BUSINESS UNDER SECTION 72
It shall be set-off against the profits and gains, if any, of any business or profession carried on by him and
assessable for that assessment year.
From this it follows that the loss from non-speculation business or profession can be set-off against the income
of the business in which it was suffered or any other business or profession either old or new including speculation
business income or from any other head, such as house property, or other sources, if the income under this
head forms part of the trading activities of the assessee. [Western States Trading Co. (P) Ltd. v. C.I.T. (1971) 80
ITR 21 (SC)].

Lesson 5 Income of Other Persons Included in Assessee’s Total Income and Set-Off or Carry Forward of Losses 349
The loss can be set-off against the business profits of the year provided such profits are asessable to tax. If the
profits are exempt from tax for any reason, no set-off can be made by the income-tax officer against such profits.
Conditions for carry forward and set-off of business loss
(i) The right of carry-forward and set-off is available to the same assessee who has sustained the loss. A
holding company however, cannot claim to carry forward the losses, if any, incurred by its wholly owned
subsidiary company. Exceptions to this rule are (a) cases of succession by inheritance [a loss incurred
by the father in the course of carrying on his business can be carried forward and set-off by his son, if
the son succeeds to the business of his father on account of the father’s death but not otherwise] (b)
accumulated business loss of an amalgamating company under Section 72A (c) the share of loss of
partnership taken over by one of its partners can also be set-off by the partner [Dwarkadass Leeladhar
v. CIT (1963) 47 ITR 619 (Ker.)]
However, loss incurred by HUF cannot be carried forward and set-off after its partition against income of
firm formed thereafter by certain coparceners [Keshrichand Bhanabhai v. CIT (1951) 20 ITR 201 (Bom.)].
(ii) The loss can be carried forward to a maximum of eight consecutive assessment years immediately
succeeding the assessment year for which the loss was first computed.
In case of a business on which rehabilitation allowance has been allowed, the previous losses are
allowed to be carried forward to the assessment year relevant to the previous year in which the business
was so revived or re-established and are allowed to be set-off against the profits of that assessment
year. Any balance of loss can be carried forward to the succeeding seven assessment years.
(iii) Where any unabsorbed depreciation or capital expenditure on scientific research has been brought
forward alongwith business loss, the business loss shall first be set-off.
In case where profits are insufficient to absorb brought forward losses, current depreciation and current
business losses, the same should be deducted in the following order:
(a) Current scientific research expenditure [under Section 35(1)].
(b) Current Depreciation [under Section 32(1)].
(c) Brought forward business losses [under Section 72(1)].
(d) Unabsorbed family planning promotion capital expenditure [under Section 36(1)(ix)].
(e) Unabsorbed Depreciation [under Section 32(2)].
(f) Unabsorbed scientific research expenditure [under Section 35(4)].
(B) LOSS IN SPECULATION BUSINESS UNDER SECTION 73
Where, for any assessment year, any loss computed in respect of a speculation business has not been wholly
set-off against the profits of another speculation business, it shall be carried forward to the following assessment
year and shall be set-off against the profits of any speculation business carried on by him and assessable for the
assessment year.

Speculative business
Explanation to section 73 provides that where any part of the business of a company (other than a company
whose gross total income consists mainly of income which is chargeable under the heads “Interest on securities”,
“Income from house property”, “Capital gains” and “Income from other sources”, or a company the principal
business of which is the business of trading in shares or banking or the granting of loans and advances) consists
in the purchase and sale of shares of other companies, such company shall, for the purposes of this section, be

350 EP-TL&P
deemed to be carrying on a speculation business to the extent to which the business consists of the purchase
and sale of such shares.
Sub-section (5) of section 43 defines the term speculative transaction as a transaction in which a contract for
purchase or sale of any commodity, including stocks and shares, is settled otherwise than by way of actual
delivery. However, the proviso to sub-section (5) of section 43 exempts, inter alia, transaction in respect of
trading in derivatives on a recognised stock exchange from its ambit.

Carry forward of losses in speculative business
In case of speculation loss even if the particular speculation business in which there is loss is discontinued, this
loss can be carried forward to be set-off in the succeeding year against the profits of any other speculation business.
This loss can be carried forward to a maximum of four consecutive assessment years immediately succeeding
the assessment year for which the loss was first computed.
However, the loss from an illegal speculation business or loss incurred in speculation business in banned items
can be neither set-off against income from any lawful speculation business nor can it be carried forward for
being set-off in the subsequent year against income even from an illegal speculation business because the law
assumes that any illegal business dies with all its losses in the same year [CIT v. Kurji Jinabhai Kotecha (1977)
107 ITR 101 (SC)].
Where any unabsorbed depreciation or capital expenditure on scientific research has been brought forward
along with speculation loss, the speculation loss shall first be set-off.
Sometimes there may be brought-forward speculation loss and current year’s non-speculation business loss.
Now the problem arises whether the brought forward speculation loss should be adjusted first against the
current year’s speculation income or current year’s non-speculative business loss should be set-off first against
the current year’s speculative income. Accordingly to the administrative instructions the Assessing Officer may
allow the assessee:
(i) either to first set-off the speculation loss carried forward from an earlier year against the speculation
profits of the current year and then to set-off the current year’s losses against other sources and against
the remaining part, if any, of the current year’s speculation profits; or
(ii) to first set-off the current year’s losses from non-speculation business and other sources against the
current year’s speculation profits and then to set-off the carried forward speculation losses of the earlier
year against the remaining part, if any, of the current year’s speculation profits, whichever is advantageous
to the assessee.
Where an assessee has brought forward speculative loss from his individual business and during the current
year he receives some speculative gains from a firm in which he is a partner, the brought forward loss can be
set-off against the speculative profits received from the firm. Similarly, where a speculation business is carried
on by sole proprietor and after his death the business is continued by legal heirs forming partnership, the firm is
entitled to carry forward and set-off such loss. [C.I.T. v. Madhukant M. Mehta (1981) 132 ITR 159 (Guj.)].
(C) CARRY FORWARD AND SET OFF OF LOSSES BY SPECIFIED BUSINESS (SECTION 73A)
(1) Any loss of any specified business in section 35AD shall not be set off except against profits and gains of any
other specified business.
(2) Where for any assessment year any loss computed of the specified business has not been wholly set off, the
loss not set off shall be carried forward to the following assessment year, and
(i) it shall be set off against the profits and gains of any specified business carried on by him and
(ii) if the loss can not be wholly set off, the amount of loss not set off shall be carried forward to the following
assessment year and so on..

Lesson 5 Income of Other Persons Included in Assessee’s Total Income and Set-Off or Carry Forward of Losses 351
(D) SET-OFF AND CARRY FORWARD OF CAPITAL LOSSES [SECTION 74]
(i) Where, in respect of any assessment year, the net result of the computation under the head “Capital gains” is a
loss to the assessee, it can be carried forward to the following assessment year. The short-term and long-term
losses shall be separately carried forward. In case of short-term capital loss it can be set off against income, if any,
under the head “Capital gains” (whether short-term or long-term) assessable for that assessment year in respect
of any other capital asset. But in case of long-term capital loss, it can be set off only against long-term capital gain.
(ii) While losses on transfer of capital assets, whether short-term or long-term cannot be set off against any other
income of the assessee under other heads of income i.e. heads other than ‘capital gains’ in the previous year in
which such loss was incurred, it can be carried forward to be set off against capital gains if any during the next
eight assessment years.
(E) LOSS ON MAINTENANCE OF RACE HORSES [SECTION 74A]
Where an assessee who is the owner of race horses sustains a loss in the activity of owning and maintaining
race horses, he can carry-forward and set-off such loss against his income (Prize money received on a race
horse or race horses) from the activity of owning and maintaining race horses in subsequent years. This loss
can be carried forward to a maximum of four assessment years immediately succeeding the assessment year
for which the loss was first computed.
(F) LOSS UNDER THE HEAD “INCOME FROM OTHER SOURCES”
Except the loss from the activity of owning and maintaining of race horses, the unabsorbed loss from no other
activity under the above head is permitted to be carried forward and set off against income of subsequent years.

CARRY FORWARD AND SET OFF OF ACCUMULATED LOSS AND UNABSORBED
DEPRECIATION ALLOWANCE IN SCHEME OF AMALGAMATION OF BANKING COMPANY IN
CERTAIN CASES (SECTION 72AA)
Section 72AA inserted by the Finance Act, 2005 provides for carry forward and set off of accumulated loss and
unabsorbed depreciation allowance in scheme of amalgamation of banking companies.
Where there has been an amalgamation of a banking company with any other banking institution under a
scheme sanctioned and brought into force by the Central Government under Sub-section (7) of Section 45 of
the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the accumulated loss and the unabsorbed depreciation of such banking
company shall be deemed to be the loss or, as the case may be, allowance for depreciation of such banking
institution for the previous year in which the scheme of amalgamation was brought into force and other provisions
of this Act relating to set-off and carry forward of loss and allowance for depreciation shall apply accordingly.
The terms, “accumulated loss”, “banking company”, “banking institution” and “unabsorbed depreciation”
for the purposes of this Section are defined as under:
(i) “accumulated loss” means so much of the loss of the amalgamating banking company under the

354 EP-TL&P
head “Profits and gains of business or profession” (not being a loss sustained in a speculation business)
which such amalgamating banking company, would have been entitled to carry forward and set-off
under the provisions of Section 72, if the amalgamation had not taken place.
(ii) “banking company” shall have the same meaning assigned to it in Clause (c) of Section 5 of the
Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (10 of 1949);
(iii) “banking institution” shall have the same meaning assigned to it in Sub-section (15) of Section 45
of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (10 of 1949);
(iv) “unabsorbed depreciation” means so much of the allowance for depreciation of the amalgamating
banking company which remains to be allowed and which would have been allowed to such banking
company if amalgamation had not taken place.

TREATMENT OF CARRY-FORWARD OF LOSSES OF CERTAIN ASSESSEES
(1) Carry-forward and set-off of losses in case of change in constitution of firm (Section 78)
Where a change has occurred in the constitution of a firm, the firm is not entitled to carry forward and set off so
much of the loss proportionate to the share of a retired or deceased partner as exceeds his share of profits, if
any, in the firm in respect of the previous year.
(2) Carry-forward and set-off of losses in case of succession of business or profession
When a business or profession is succeeded by another person, the brought forward losses by the predecessor
can be set-off against the income earned by the predecessor before the succession. The successor is not
entitled to carry forward the losses sustained by the predecessor and set them off against the income earned by
him. However, there is exception. If the succession is by inheritance, the heir-at-law is entitled to carry-forward
and set-off the losses sustained by the predecessor provided the business in question continues to be carried
on by the successor.
(3) Carry-forward and set-off of losses of companies in which the public are not substantially interested
(Section 79)
The losses of companies in which the public are not substantially interested can be carried forward and set-off
only if the following condition is satisfied:
(a) The shares of the company carrying not less than 51 per cent of the voting power were beneficially held
by the same persons on the last day of the year or years in which the loss was incurred and also on the
last day of the previous year in which the brought forward loss is to be adjusted. Where a change in
voting power of more than 51 per cent of share holding has occurred between the two dates mentioned
above (i.e. last day of the year of occurrence of loss and the last day of the previous year in which the
brought forward loss is to be adjusted), the assessee will not be entitled to the benefit of set-off.
However, the benefit of set-off will not be denied if the change in voting power is due to the death of a shareholder
or on account of transfer of shares by way of gift to any relative of the shareholder making such gift.
The effect of this provision is that if the majority of the voting power is not in the same hands both on the last day
of the previous year in which the loss was sustained by the closely-held company and on the last day of the
previous year in which the set off is claimed, set off will not be allowed under Section 72. This is obviously to
frustrate attempts at trafficking in losses.
It has been further provided by Finance Act, 1999 w.e.f. 1.4.2000 that benefit of set off will also not be denied in
the case where any change in the shareholding of an Indian company which is a subsidiary of a foreign company
as a result of amalgamation or demerger of a foreign company subject to the condition that fifty one per cent
shareholders of the amalgamating or demerged foreign company continue.

SUBMISSION OF RETURN FOR LOSS (SECTION 80)
An assessee is not entitled to carry-forward a loss unless he has filed a return of loss to the Department in time
and in the prescribed form. It is obligatory on the part of the assessee to file such return, otherwise he will be
deprived of the benefit of carry-forward of losses. In fact, only that amount of loss is allowed to be carriedforward which has been computed by the Assessing Officer and not by the assessee.
Section 80 of the Act provides that a loss which has not been determined in pursuance of return filed u/s 139(3)
shall not be carried forward and set-off u/s 72(1), 73(2), 74(1), 74(3), 74A. Previously, it does not include Section
73A which provides that any loss, computed in respect of any specified business referred to in section 35AD.
Section 80 of the Act has been amended by Finance Act, 2016 to provide that the loss determined u/s 73A shall
not be allowed to be carried forward and set off unless it is determined in pursuance of a return filed u/s 139(3).
These amendments effective retrospectively from 1st April, 2016 and accordingly apply in relation to the
assessment year 2016-17 and subsequent years.

the transfer, all income accruing to the transferee from the asset shall be included in the total income
of the transferor.
– The income under revocable transfer of asset shall be included in the income of transferor even when
only a part of income from transferred asset has been applied for the transferor.
– Irrevocable Transfer: In case of an irrevocable transfer of assets for a specified period, the income
from such assets shall not be included in the income of transferor.
– Income to spouse from a concern in which such individual has substantial interest [Section
64(1)(ii)]: All such income as arises directly or indirectly, to the spouse of an individual by way of
salary, commission, fees or any other remuneration, whether in cash or kind from a concern in which
such individual has a substantial interest, shall be included in the income of the individual.

income of the assessee can either be recovered from the assessee or from the other person. The
liability of other person is limited to the portion of the tax levied on the assessee which is attributable
to the income so included.
– Set Off - carry Forward of losses: Sometimes the assessee incurs a loss from a source of income
and unless such loss is set-off against any income, the net result of the assessee’s activities during
the particular accounting year cannot be ascertained and consequently the tax payable would also be
incapable of determination. For this purpose, the Income-tax Act contains specific provisions (Sections
70 to 80) for the set-off and carry-forward of losses.
– Set-Off of Losses from one source against Income from another source under the same Head

assessment year in which these occurred, so much of the loss as has not been so set-off out of the
following losses, can be carried forward to the following assessment year and so on to be set-off
against the income of those years provided the losses have been determined in pursuance of a return
filed by the asessee and it is the same assessee who sustained the loss.
However, losses suffered under the following heads are not allowed to be carried forward and set off:

Deductions from Gross Total Income 361

Deductions from Gross Total Income
LESSON OUTLINE

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
The deductions are available only to the
assessees where the gross total income is
positive. If however, the gross total income is
nil or negative, the question of any deduction
from the gross total income does not arise. For
this purpose, the expression ‘gross total income’
means the total income of the assessee
computed in accordance with the provisions of
the Income-Tax Act, before making any
deduction under Chapter VIA, i.e., the aggregate
income computed under each head, after giving
effect to the provisions for clubbing of income
and set off of losses, is known as “Gross Total
Income”. Sections 80A to 80U of the Incometax Act lay down the provisions relating to the
deductions allowable to assessees from their
gross total income. The income arising after
deduction under section 80A to 80U is called
Total Income.

– Deductions in relation to various investments
– Sections 80C to 80GGC

INTRODUCTION
The scheme of the Income-tax Act is to provide for various tax exemptions and concessions in three forms,
namely –
(i) Incomes which are wholly exempt from tax by virtue of their exclusion from the scope of total income
under Sections 10 to 13A (Covered in Lesson 3);
(ii) Incomes which are includible in the total income for rate purposes but are entitled for rebate under
Section 86; and
(iii) Deductions from gross total income which are allowed for the purposes of computing total income in
respect of payments, investment and incomes.
At the outset, it must be noted that the deductions from gross total income are available only to the assessees
where the gross total income is a positive figure. If however, the gross total income is nil or is a loss, the
question of any deduction from the gross total income does not arise. For this purpose, the expression ‘gross
total income’ means the total income of the assessee computed in accordance with the provisions of the Incometax Act before making any deduction under Chapter VIA. The aggregate of income computed under each head,
after giving effect to the provisions for clubbing of income and set off of losses, is known as “Gross Total Income”.
Sections 80A to 80U of the Income-tax Act lay down the provisions relating to the deductions allowable to
assessees from their gross total income. However, the aggregate amount of the deductions shall not exceed the
gross total income of the assessee.
These deductions are allowed from gross total income after reducing the following incomes from gross
total income:
– Long-term Capital Gains
– Short-term Capital Gains under Section 111A
– Income from Lotteries
– Income under Sections 115A, 115AB, 115AC, 115ACA, 115AD, 115BBA, 115D

RELIEF AND REBATE IN RESPECT OF INCOME-TAX
In addition to the provisions for aggregation discussed earlier, Section 66 lays down that in computing the total
income of any assessee, there shall be included certain items of income on which no income-tax is payable
under Chapter VII. Accordingly the provisions of Section 86 would be applicable.

SHARE OF MEMBER OF AN ASSOCIATION OF PERSONS OR BODY OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE
INCOME OF THE ASSOCIATION OR BODY (SECTION 86)
This section as substituted by the Finance Act, 1992 with effect from the assessment year 1993-94 provides that
no income tax shall be payable by the assessee who is a member of an association of persons or body of
individuals (other than, a company or a co-operative society or a society registered under the Societies Registration
Act, 1860 or under any law corresponding to that Act in force in any part of India) in respect of his share in the
income of such association or body computed in the manner provided in Section 67A of the Act.
Further, where the association or body is chargeable to tax at the maximum marginal rate or any higher rate
under any of the provisions of this Act, the share of a member computed as aforesaid shall not be included in his
total income. However, in any other case, the share of a member shall form part of his total income.
It is also provided that where no income-tax is chargeable on the total income of the association or body. The
share of a member computed as aforesaid shall be chargeable to tax as part of his total income and nothing
contained in this section shall apply to the case.

INCOME FROM AN ASSOCIATION OF PERSONS OR A BODY OF INDIVIDUALS (SECTION 86)
Where the assessee is a member of an association of persons or body of individuals other than a company or a cooperative society or a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 or under any law corresponding
to that Act in force in any part of India), income-tax shall not be payable by the assessee in respect of his share in
the income of the association or body computed in the manner provided in Section 67A that –
(a) where the association or body is chargeable to tax on its total income at the maximum marginal rate or
any higher rate, under any of the provisions of this Act, the shares of a member computed as aforesaid
shall not be included in his total income;
(b) in any other case, the share of a member computed as aforesaid shall form part of his total income;
Provided further that where no income-tax is chargeable on the total income of the association or body, the
share of a member computed as aforesaid shall be chargeable to tax as part of his total income and nothing
contained in this section apply to the case.

REBATE OF INCOME-TAX IN CASE OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS (SECTION 87A)
An assessee, being an individual resident in India, whose total income does not exceed 5 lakh rupees, shall be
entitled to a deduction, from the amount of income-tax on his total income with which he is chargeable for any
assessment year, of an amount equal to 100% of such income tax or an amount of 5,000 rupees, whichever is less.
In simple words, with a view to provide tax relief to the individual tax payers who are in lower income bracket,
rebate from the tax payable by an assessee is provided to an individual, resident in India, whose total income
does not exceed five lakh rupees.
The rebate shall be equal to the amount of income-tax payable on the total income for any assessment year or
an amount of 5,000 rupees, whichever is less.
Consequently any individual having income up to ` 3,00,000 will not be required to pay any tax and every
individual having total income above ` 3,00,000/- but not exceeding ` 5,00,000/- shall get a tax relief of ` 5000/-.
With the objective to provide relief to resident individuals in the lower income slab, Section 87A of the Act has

Lesson 6

Deductions from Gross Total Income 397

been amended so as to increase the maximum amount of rebate available under this provision from existing Rs.
2,000 to Rs. 5,000.
This amendment effective from 1st April, 2017 and accordingly apply in relation to assessment year
2017-18 and subsequent assessment years.

RELIEF WHEN SALARY IS PAID IN ARREARS OR IN ADVANCE [SECTION 89]
It has been explained earlier that arrears and advances of salary are assessed in the hands of the employee in
the year they are received. Consequently, in a financial year, an employee may become chargeable to tax in
respect of salary for more than twelve months. Likewise, any payment in the nature of profit in lieu of salary
[Section 17(3)] is also chargeable in the year of receipt or the year when it became due in addition to the normal
salary received by him. In consequence the income swells and the average rate of tax too. In order to remove
this hardship, the Assessing Officer has been empowered to grant relief in appropriate cases in accordance with
Rule 21AA of the Income-tax Rules, 1962.
Provided that no such relief shall be granted in respect of any amount received or receivable by an assessee on
his voluntary retirement or termination of his service, in accordance with any scheme or schemes of voluntary
retirement or in the case of a public sector company referred to in subclause (i) of clause (10C) of section 10, a
scheme of voluntary separation, if an exemption in respect of any amount received or receivable on such
voluntary retirement or termination of his service or voluntary separation has been claimed by the assessee
under clause (10C) of section 10 in respect of such, or any other, assessment year.
RELIEF UNDER SECTION 89 IS PROVIDED IN THE FOLLOWING CASES:
– in respect of salary received in advance or in arrears;
– in respect of arrears of family pension;
– in respect of gratuity;
– in respect of compensation on termination of employment;
– in respect of commutation of pension;
– in respect of other payment.

TAXATION OF HINDU UNDIVIDED FAMILIES
The term ‘Hindu undivided family’ has not been defined in the Income-tax Act. However, in general parlance it
means an undivided family of Hindus. Creation of a HUF is a God-gifted phenomenon. As soon as a married
Hindu gets a child, a new HUF comes into existence. It is not at all necessary that every HUF must have joint
property or family income. [R. Subramania Iyer v. CIT (1955) 28, ITR, 352]. However, to become an assessee
under the Income-tax Act, there must be ‘income-yielding’ joint property of the family.
A HUF may consist of a number of smaller HUFs. A smaller HUF has a legal existence and may be assessable
as a unit distinct from the apex joint family even when the bigger HUF is in place [CIT v. Khanna (1963) 49 ITR
232].
Under Hindu Law, a Joint Hindu Family consists of all persons lineally descended from a common ancestor
(except those who have separated from the joint family by partitioning of assets) and includes their wives and
unmarried daughters, and also a stranger who has been adopted by the family. [Surjit lal Chhabra v. CIT (1975)
101, ITR, p.776 (S.C.)].
The Supreme Court’s decision in the case of Surjit Lal Chhabra v. CIT (1975 101 ITR 776) has come to stay as
one of the leading case laws. The ratio laid down by the Supreme Court had been applied by the Andhra
Pradesh, Orissa and Madras High Courts, followed by Bombay, Patna, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi High Courts
and relied upon by the Punjab High Court. In the latest case, the Delhi High Court held in Commissioner of
Income-tax v. S.P. Chopra (1991, 191 ITR 455) that the income from the half share of the property had to be
treated as the individual income of the assessee under the personal law and not as income of the family. The
character of the property had to be determined in accordance with the personal law of the assessee and not on
the basis of how the property had been treated by the revenue in respect of earlier assessments.
A son conceived or in his mother’s womb is equal in many respects to a son actually in existence, viz., inheritance,
partition, survivorship etc. But this doctrine does not apply to the Income-tax Act. Hence, a son conceived is not
treated a member of the H.U.F. for Income-tax purposes. [T.S. Srinivasan v. C.I.T., (1966) 60, ITR, p.36 (S.C.)].
Jain and Sikh undivided families are also treated as Hindu undivided families unless, under special circumstances,
the assessee claims not to be treated as such. If such claim is made, the assessee shall have to prove that
there is some such custom in his family on account of which it cannot be treated as a Hindu undivided family.
A Hindu does not cease to be a Hindu merely because he declared for the purpose of the Special Marriage Act,
1872, that he does not profess Hindu Religion. Such a Hindu does form an H.U.F. with his children from such
marriage. [CIT v. Partap Chand (1959), 36 ITR, 262]. Similarly, a Muslim family governed by the
Marumakkathayam law constitutes ‘Tarwad’ or ‘Thavazhi’ and falls within the definition of a H.U.F. [V.K.P. Abdul
Kadar Haji v. Ag. ITO (1967) 66, ITR, 173].
If a Hindu gets converted as a Christian, the family of such a person will not be a HUF. However a Hindu, along
with his son (by a christian wife) who has been brought up as a Hindu will be a HUF. [CWT v. R. Sridharan (1976)
104, ITR, 436 (S.C.)].
A Hindu Joint Family consists of two types of members:
(i) Coparceners: The lineal male descendants of a person upto the third generation of such person are
known as coparceners. The coparceners acquire, on birth, ownership in the ancestral properties of such
ascendant and have a right to claim partition of such property at any time. However, w.e.f. 9.9.2005 due to
amendment of Hindu Succession Act, the daughter of a coparcener shall by birth become a coparcener in
her own right in the same manner as the son. Hence, the daughter can also ask for partition.
(ii) Other members: Such members include wives of male members of the family and other male
members.

Lesson 7 Computation of Tax Liability of HUF/ Firm/Association of Persons/Co-operative Societies 407
Thus, a Hindu Joint Family may consist of:
(a) All persons lineally descended from a common ancestor and includes their wives and daughters (w.e.f.
9.9.2005).
(b) A male and widow or widows of deceased male member or members. [Gowli Buddanna v. C.I.T. (1966)
60, ITR, p. 293 (S.C.)]
However, an unmarried coparcener who receives share on the partition of joint family properties, cannot form a
Hindu undivided family unless he marries. After his marriage, he can hold the property received from family as
joint family property consisting of himself and his wife. [C. Krishna Prasad v. C.I.T. (1974) 97, p. 493 (S.C.)].
Karta: Property of the family is ordinarily managed by the father or other senior member for the time being of
the family. He is called Karta. However, the senior member may give up his right of management and a junior
member may be appointed as Karta with the consent of all other members. [Narendra Kumar J. Modi v. CIT
(1976) 105, ITR, 109 (S.C.)]. In the absence of a male member in the family or when all male members are
minors, a woman member can be treated as manager of the family for income-tax purposes. [Smt. Champa
Kumari Singhi v. Addl. Member of the Board of Revenue (1962) 46, ITR, p. 81].
Since daughter is also a copacener w.e.f. 9.9.05, it may be presumed that daughter can also be karta of her
fathers HUF.
Joint Property of the family:
It consists of:
(i) ancestral property;
(ii) accretion thereto;
(iii) acquisition with joint funds; and
(iv) self-acquired property of any member thrown by him into the common stock to be treated as family
property. In the case of Pushpa Devi v. C.I.T. the Supreme Court has held that a Hindu female, not
being a coparcener, cannot blend her separate property with Joint family property. However, she can
make a gift of her property to the family. [(1977) 109, ITR p. 730].
The Supreme Court’s decision in the case of Pushpa Devi v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1977, 109 ITR 730)
had been later followed by the Calcutta, Andhra Pradesh and Madras High Courts. In the latest case, the
Madras High Court held in the case of Rajathy Ammal v. Commissioner of Wealth-tax (1987, 164 ITR 605) that
a female member could not throw her property into the family hotchpotch and the only way she could achieve
her purpose was either by gifting it or selling to the family.
Further, Section 64(2) provides that where an individual being a member of Hindu undivided family transfers his
separate property after 31st December, 1969 to the family for the common benefit of the family, otherwise than
for adequate consideration, such property is known as converted property. The income derived from the converted
property or any part thereof shall be included in the total income of the transferor individual and not in the income
of the family.
School of Hindu Law: According to Hindu Law, HUFs are governed by two schools viz. Mitakshara and
Dayabhaga.
Mitakshara School applies to whole of India except the states of West Bengal and Assam.
Dayabhaga school applies to the States of West Bengal and Assam. The difference between the two schools is
as under:
(i) Foundation: In the Mitakashara School, the foundation of a coparcenary is laid down when a son is

408 EP-TL&P
born to the Mitakshara father. Under the Dayabhaga school the foundation of a coparcenary is laid on
the death of the father leaving, as survivors, one or more sons.
(ii) Right to partition: A Mitakshara son, in whom the interest in family property is vested by birth, all along
possesses a right to demand partition. A Dayabhaga son, on the other hand acquires no interest in the
family property by birth and, consequently, has no right to demand partition of the HUF property from
his father.
(iii) Quantum of share: Under Mitakshara Law, each coparcener takes as undefined share in the coparcenary
property. The share of the members decreases by birth in the family and increases upon death of a
coparcener. A Dayabhaga coparcener, on the other hand, always takes a defined share in the property
left by his deceased father. Thus, the heirs of a deceased governed by the Dayabhaga school do not
constitute a HUF automatically on the death of the deceased and cannot be assessed as a HUF unless
they have by mutual consent agreed to form a joint family.
(iv) Gift out of ancestral property: A Mitakshara Karta may make a gift of movable property of the family,
out of love and affection, within reasonable limits. He can also make a gift of immovable properties,
within reasonable limits for pious purposes; i.e., for charitable and religious purposes or to a daughter in
fulfilment of a nuptial promise etc. However, a gift to a stranger is void. On the contrary, a Dayabhaga
father can alienate ancestral property, both movable as well as immovable, by sale, gift, will or otherwise
in the same way as he can dispose of his separate property.

Position under Hindu Succession Act, 1956
This Act came into force on and from 17th June, 1956. It lays down a uniform and comprehensive system of
inheritance and applies to persons governed by the Mitakshara as well as the Dayabhaga Schools, superseding
and abrogating all previous law or customs or usage having the force of law.
Under this Act, the heirs of a male Hindu dying intestate on or after 17th June, 1956 are divided into three
classes. Class I heirs get the right to the deceased’s property simultaneously to the exclusion of all other
Classes of heirs. Class II relations succeed only if there is no class I relation and, the heirs in the first entry of
class II being preferred to heirs in the second entry, and so on, but heirs in any one entry taking in equal shares
amongst themselves.
The students should note that Section 4 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 clearly lays down that “save as
otherwise expressly provided in the Act, any text, rule or interpretation of Hindu Law or any custom or usage as
part of that law in force immediately before the commencement of the Act shall cease to have effect with respect
to any matter for which provision is made in the Act.” And, Section 8 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, lays
down the scheme of succession to the property of a Hindu dying intestate. The schedule classifies the heirs on
which such property shall devolve.
The preferential heirs of class I are as under:
(1) Son (2) Daughter (3) Widow (4) Mother (5) Son/daughter/widow of a predeceased son (6) son/daughter of a
predeceased daughter (7) Son/daughter/ widow of a predeceased son of a predeceased son.
A son’s son is not mentioned as an heir under Class I of the schedule and, therefore, he cannot get any right in
the property of his grandfather under the provision. The right of a son’s son in his grandfather’s property during
the lifetime of his father which existed under the Hindu Law as in force before the Act, is not saved expressly by
the Act and, therefore the earlier interpretation of Hindu Law giving a right by birth in such property ‘ceased to
have effect’.
Therefore, the property which devolves on a Hindu on the death of his father intestate after coming into force of
the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, does not constitute H.U.F. property consisting of his own branch including his
sons. [Shri Vallabhdas Modani v. C.I.T. (1982) 138, ITR, p. 673].

Lesson 7 Computation of Tax Liability of HUF/ Firm/Association of Persons/Co-operative Societies 409
The Allahabad High Court’s decision supra in the case of Shri Vallabhdas Modani v. Commissioner of Incometax was followed by the Andhra Pradesh High Court (1983, 144 ITR 18) and later approved by the Supreme
Court in the case of Commissioner of Wealth-Tax v. Chander Sen (1986, 161 ITR 370) holding that it is not
possible to say that when a son inherits the property in the situation contemplated by the Hindu Succession Act,
1956, he takes as Karta of his own undivided family.

Computation of Income of the H.U.F.
The gross total income of the family for the relevant previous year shall be computed under the relevant heads
(as per the provisions of the Income-tax Act) as it is computed for other assessees. However, in this connection
the following points are worth noting:
Clubbing of Income
(i) If the funds of a Hindu Undivided family are invested in a company or a firm, fees or remuneration
received by the member as a director, or a partner in the company or firm may be treated as income of
the family in case the fees or remuneration is earned essentially as a result of investment of funds. But,
if the fees or remuneration is earned essentially for services rendered by the member in his personal
capacity, the income shall constitute the personal income of the member.
(ii) For determining whether a particular income belongs to a member of the family or to his undivided
family, the Supreme Court has enunciated certain principles. The question to be considered in such
cases is, whether the remuneration received by the coparcener is in substance merely a mode of return
made to the family because of the investment of the family funds in the business or whether it is a
compensation for services rendered by the coparcener. If it is the former, it is an income of the HUF but
if it is the latter it is the income of the individual. If the income was essentially earned as a result of the
funds invested, the fact that a coparcener has rendered some service would not change the character
of the receipt. But if, on the other hand, it is essentially a remuneration for the services rendered by the
coparcener, the circumstances that his services were availed of because of the reason that he was a
member of the family which had invested funds in that business or that he had obtained the qualification
shares from out of the family funds would not make the receipt the income of the HUF. [Raj Kumar
Singh Hukam Chandji v. CIT (1970) 78 ITR 33].
The Supreme Court’s decision supra in the case of Raj Kumar Singh Hukam Chandji v. Commissioner
of Income-tax has come to stay as one of the most followed/applied case laws. This decision had
been followed by Patna (Full Bench), Allahabad, Bombay and Gujarat High Courts, applied by Andhra
Pradesh, Madras, Kerala, Delhi, and Supreme Court itself. It would suffice to refer to the Supreme
Court’s decision in the case of Y.L. Aggarwalla and others v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1978, 114
ITR 471) holding that the share income was a return made to the family because of the investments
of the family funds in the business and the share income was not the individual income of minor
sons but was the income of the Hindu undivided family and had to be assessed in the hands of the
family.
(iii) Where a member of a HUF is a partner in a firm on behalf of the family and on partition of the property
of the family, the share in the firm is allotted to such a member, subsequent to such allotment when the
firm settles its accounts the whole income for that year would be the income of the individual member
and no part of the income would be added to the income of the family. [CIT v. Ashok Bhai Chiman Bhai
(1965) 56, ITR, 42 (S.C.)].
(iv) The personal earning, including income from self acquired property of a member of the HUF, even
though he has sons, would not be included in the income of the family. Such income shall be assessed
as income of that individual. [Kalyanji Vithal Das v. CIT (1937) 5 ITR 90 (PC)].

410 EP-TL&P
(v) Any sum paid by an HUF to a member of the family out of its income is not deductible in computing the
income of the family. However, such amount will not be included in the income of such individual
whether the family had paid tax on its income or not [Section 10(2)].
(vi) If any remuneration is paid by the Hindu Undivided family to the karta or any other member for
services rendered by him in conducting family’s business, the remuneration is deductible if
remuneration is (a) paid under a valid and bona fide agreement; (b) in the interest of, and expedient
for, the business of family; and (c) genuine and not excessive. Jugal Kishore Baldeo Sahai v. CIT
[1967] 63 ITR 238 (SC).
(vii) If salary is paid by the Hindu undivided family to its karta for looking after its interest in firms in which it
is partner through said karta, such salary is allowable as deduction - CIT v. Prakash Chand Agarwal
[1982] 11 Taxman 55 (MP).
(viii) Income from ‘stridhan’ is not includible in the income of the family. Property derived by a woman from
her father or brother or husband or any other relative either before or after her marriage is known as
‘stridhan’.
(ix) If a member has converted or transferred without adequate consideration after December 31, 1969 his
self-acquired property into joint family property, income from such property is not taxable in the hands
of the family.
(x) Income from impartible estate is taxable in the hands of the holder of the estate and not in the hands of
the Hindu undivided family. Though, the impartible estate belongs to the family, income arising therefrom
belongs to the holder of the estate who is the senior most male member of the family. Income from
impartible estate is taxable in the hands of the holder of the estate.
(xi) Personal income of the members cannot be treated as income of Hindu undivided family.
(xii) Under the Dayabhaga School of law, as stated in a preceding page, no son has any right in the
ancestral property during the lifetime of his father. If, therefore, the father does not have any brother as
a coparcener, income arising from ancestral property is taxable as his individual income.

Partition of a Hindu undivided family (Section 171)
‘Partition’ signifies division of property. In the cases of property capable of physical division, share of each
member is determined by making physical division thereof. It must be noted that a division of income without
physical division of property does not amount to partition. Where, however, the property is not capable of
physical division, partition implies such division as the property may admit.
Who is entitled to share on partition
Though only coparceners can demand partition, once the partition takes effect, the following persons are entitled
to a share:
(a) all coparceners;
(b) a son in the womb of his mother at the time of partition;
(c) mother, who gets an equal share if the partition takes place among her sons after the death of her
husband; and
(d) wife, who gets a share equal to that of a son at the time of a partition between father and sons.
Assessment after partition (Section 171)
A joint family, once assessed as a HUF, continues to be assessed as such till one or more coparceners claim
partition. Such claim must be made by the coparceners before the assessment of the income of the HUF for the

Lesson 7 Computation of Tax Liability of HUF/ Firm/Association of Persons/Co-operative Societies 411
relevant assessment year is completed. On the receipt of such a claim, the Assessing Officer must make an
inquiry after giving due notice to the members and record a finding whether there has been a partition and, if so,
the date of the partition. The income of the family from the first day of the previous year to the date of partition
is assessed as income of the HUF and from the next date of the partition to the date of close of the previous year,
as the individual income of the recipient-members. If the recipient member forms another HUF along with his
wife and son(s), the income of the property which was subject to partition is chargeable to tax in the hands of the
new H.U.F.
A partition of the HUF can be both total and partial
Where the entire joint family property is divided among all coparceners and the family ceases to exist as an
undivided family, the partition is total. A partial partition may be as regards: (a) the persons constituting the joint
family, or (b) the properties belonging to the joint family, or (c) both. The device of partial partition has been
used as a medium for reduction of proper tax liability. To curb such a practice, the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1980
inserted Sub-section 9 in Section 171 which lays down that partial partitions of HUFs effected after 31st Dec.,
1978 will not be recognised for tax purposes.
The provisions made by Sub-section (9) in Section 171 are as follows:
(i) In a case where a partial partition of a HUF has taken place after 31.12.1978, no claim of such partition
will be enquired into and the Assessing Officer will not record a finding as to whether there has been a
partition of the family property. Further, any finding regarding partial partition recorded under Section
171(3) will be null and void and of no legal effect.
(ii) Such family will continue to be assessed as if no such partial partition has taken place, i.e., the property
or source of income will be deemed to continue to belong to the Hindu undivided family and no member
will be deemed to have separated from the family.
(iii) Each member or group of members of such family will be jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest,
penalty, fine or other sum payable under the Act by the family, whether before or after such partition.
The several liability of any member or group of members of such family will be computed according to
the portion of the joint family property allotted to him on such partial partition. This amendment has
come into force with effect from April 1, 1980 and has, accordingly, been applicable with effect from
assessment year 1980-81 and onwards.

TAXATION OF FIRMS
Under Section 2(23) of the Income-tax Act, the terms “firm”, “partner”, and “partnership” have the meanings
respectively assigned to them in the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 and Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008.
The expression “partner” also includes a minor who has been admitted to the benefits of partnership and
a partner of a Limited Liability Partnership Act 2008. However a minor cannot validly enter into any
partnership as a ‘full partner’ with other persons but he can be admitted to the benefits of partnership only.
A joint Hindu family as such cannot be a partner in a firm. However, through its Karta it may enter into a valid
partnership with a third person or with a member of the undivided family in his individual capacity. In such a
case, the Karta occupies a dual position. On the partnership he functions in his individual capacity; on the
relations to other members of the Hindu undivided family, in his representative capacity.
An incorporated company being a legal person may form a partnership with an individual or with another company.
In considering the maximum number of partners comprising a firm, the company will be considered as one
person only.
A partnership firm as such is not entitled to enter into a partnership with another firm, H.U.F., individual, or a
company. However, its partners in their individual capacity can enter into another partnership.

412 EP-TL&P
Scheme of taxation of a firm and its partners
Assessment as a Firm (Section 184)
As per the scheme, a partnership firm in the first assesment year shall be assessed as a firm if the following
conditions are satisfied:
1. The partnership is evidenced by an instrument i.e. partnership deed.
2. The individual shares of the partners are specified in that instrument.
3. A copy of the partnership deed certified by all the partners in writing (other than the minors) is submitted
along with the return of income in respect of which assessment as a firm is first sought.
Where the return is made after the dissolution of the firm, the copy of the partnership deed should be certified in
writing by all persons (excluding minors) who were partners of the firm immediately before its dissolution and by
the legal representative of any deceased partner.
When a firm is assessed as such for any assessment year, it shall be assessed in the same capacity for
every subsequent year if there is no change in the constitution of the firm or in the shares of partners as
evidenced by the partnership deed on the basis of which assessment as a firm was first sought.
Where any such change has taken place in the previous year, the firm shall furnish a certified copy of the
revised instrument of partnership along with the return of income for the assessment year relevant to such
previous year. In doing so all the provisions of Section 184 will apply to the firm.
Circumstances where the firm will be assessed as a firm but shall not be eligible for deduction on account of
interest, salary, bonus, etc.
Where the firm –
(a) fails to make the return required under Section 139(1) and has not made a return or revised return
under Section 139(4) or 139(5), or
(b) fails to comply with all the terms of a notice issued under Section 142(1) or fails to comply with a
direction issued under Section 142(2A), or
(c) having made a return, fails to comply with all the terms of a notice issued under Section 143(2),
(d) does not comply with three conditions mentioned above u/s 184.
then the firm shall not be eligible for any deduction on account of interest to a partner and remuneration to a
working partner although the same is mentioned in the partnership deed.
Rate of tax
In the case of a firm which is assessable as such (i.e. as a firm), tax is chargeable on its total income at the
rate of 30%
Surcharge @12% shall be applicable where the total income exceeds ` 1 crore.
Partnership is not a separate entity distinct from the partners, but for tax purposes a partnership is taxed as a
separate entity and therefore total income will be computed under various heads of income. A partnership firm is
also entitled for deductions under section 30 to 37 for expenditures incurred. However, for payment of remuneration
to partners and interest on capital are allowed subject to conditions laid down under section 40(b).
Section 40(b), contain the following conditions which need to be complied with while making payment of
remuneration and interest on borrowed capital to the partners:
(i) Payment of salary, bonus, commission or remuneration by whatever name called to a non-working

Lesson 7 Computation of Tax Liability of HUF/ Firm/Association of Persons/Co-operative Societies 413
partner shall not be allowed as deduction. Such payments are allowed only to working partners if it is
authorised by and is in accordance with partnership deed.
(ii) Interest payable to a partner, although authorised by the partnership deed shall be allowable as deduction
subject to a maximum of 12% p.a. If the partnership deed provides for interest at less than 12% p.a, the
deduction of interest shall be allowed to the extent provided by the partnership deed.
(iii) the payment of remuneration to working partner, although authorised by partnership deed however it is
subject to maximum of the following limits.
Finance Act, 2009 provides for uniform limits for both professional firms and non professional firms:
I.

On the first Rs. 3,00,000 of the book-profit
or in case of a loss

Rs. 1,50,000 or 90% of the book-profit, whichever
is more.

II.

On the balance of the book-profit

60% of the book profits.

Meaning of Book Profit [Explanation 3 to section 40(b)]
Book-profit” means the net profit, as shown in the profit and loss account and make the additions and deductions
as per section 28 to 44D explained under the head income from Business and Profession increased by the
aggregate amount of the remuneration paid or payable to all the partners of the firm if such amount has been
deducted while computing the net profit. Interest paid/payable to partners in excess of 12% shall also be disallowed
as per section 40(b).
Change in Constitution of a Firm (Section 187)
Where at the time of making an assessment under Section 143 or Section 144 of the Act it is found that a change
has occurred in the constitution of a firm, the assessment will be made on the firm as constituted at the time of
making the assessment.
For the purposes of this section there is a change in the constitution of a firm if:
(a) one or more of the partners cease to be partners or one or more new partners are admitted, in such
circumstances that one or more of the persons who were partners of the firm before the change continue
as partner or partners after the change (this clause, however, shall not apply to a case where the firm is
dissolved on the death of any of its partners) or
(b) where all the partners continue with a change in their respective shares or in the shares of some of them.
Losses of Registered Firms (Section 75)
Carry forward and set off of losses in case of change in constitution of firm or on succession [Section 78(1)]
Where a change has occurred in the constitution of a firm on account of death or retirement, the firm is not
entitled to carry forward and set off so much of the loss proportionate to the share of a retired or deceased
partner as exceeds his share of profits, if any, in the firm in respect of the previous year.
Method of computation of amount not to be allowed to be carried forward
Step 1: In the year of change first ascertain the share of outgoing partner in the profit or loss of the firm.
Step 2: Compute share of loss of the outgoing partner for each of the preceding years from which the loss
is carried forward.
Step 3: Amount not allowed to be carried forward:
(i) Sum of [Amounts computed in Steps (1) and (2) where there is loss in the year of change].
(ii) Difference of [Amounts computed in Steps (1) and (2) in case of profit in the year of change].

414 EP-TL&P
Carry forward of unabsorbed depreciation
As section 78 is not applicable in the case of unabsorbed depreciation, and unabsorbed capital expenditure
on scientific research, these unadjusted allowances (without deducting share of the outgoing partner) can
be carried forward by the reconstituted firm.

Assessment of Partners
As per Section 10(2A) of the Act, any person who is a partner of a firm which is assessed as such, his share in
the total income of the firm will not be included in computing his total income. Partner includes a minor
admitted to the benefits of partnership as per Section 2(23) of the Act.
Further, the explanation to Sub-clause (2A) provides that the share of a partner in the total income of the firm
assessed as a firm shall be an amount which bears to the total income of the firm the same proportion as the
amount of his share in the profits of the firm (in accordance with the partnership deed) bears to such profits.
In terms of a formula, the amount exempt would be:
Partners share in the profit of the firm =

as shown in the partnership deed
Total Profits of the Firm

 Total income of the firm

Any interest, salary, bonus, commission or remuneration by whatever name called which is due to or received
by a partner of a firm from the firm will be chargeable to tax in the hands of the partner under the head “profits
and gains of business or profession”. However, if such salary, interest, bonus, commission or remuneration (or
any part thereof) has not been allowed as deduction as per Section 40(b) in the hands of the firm, the amount
not allowed as deduction shall not be charged to tax in the hands of partners.
Further, deductions under Sections 32 to 37 can be claimed by a partner from any income where any expenditure
was incurred to earn such income.

Succession of one firm by another firm (Section 188)
When all the partners in the predecessor firm are replaced by new partners in the successor firm, it is known as
succession of one firm by another firm. If a firm is dissolved and some of the partners take over the firm’s
business or carry on a similar business with or without new partners, it would be a case of succession by a new
firm (62 I.T.R. 75).
In CIT v. K.H. Chambers (1965) 55 ITR 674, the Supreme Court laid down the following requisites of succession:
(i) There is a change of ownership.
(ii) The whole business is transferred.
(iii) Substantially the identity and the continuity of the business are preserved.
Where the partnership deed does not provide specifically for continuance of the firm on the death of a partner,
there would be no change in constitution of the firm but it would be a case of succession. [Addl. CIT v.
Thyagasundara Mudaliar (1981) 127 ITR 520].
Where a firm is succeeded by another firm, separate assessments are made on the predecessor and successor
firms respectively in accordance with the provisions of Section 170 which provides that the predecessor shall
be assessed in respect of the income of the previous year in which the succession took place up to the date
of succession and the successor shall be assessed in respect of the income of the previous year after the
date of succession. If the predecessor cannot be found, or the tax assessed on the predecessor cannot be
recovered from him for the previous year (in which the succession took place) and the previous year immediately

Lesson 7 Computation of Tax Liability of HUF/ Firm/Association of Persons/Co-operative Societies 415
preceding such previous year, the unrealised tax payable by the predecessor shall be recovered from the
successor.
However, the successor firm is entitled to recover from the predecessor firm any tax paid by it on behalf of the
former. If any tax is due against any partner of the predecessor firm, it cannot be recovered from the successor
firm.
Joint and several liability of partners for tax payable by firm (Section 188A)
As per this section every person who was, during the previous year, a partner of a firm, and the legal representative
of any such person who is deceased, shall be jointly and severally liable along with the firm for the amount of tax,
penalty or other sum payable by the firm for the assessment year to which such previous year is relevant, and all
the provisions of Income-tax Act, so far as may be, shall apply to the assessment of such tax or imposition or
levy of such penalty or other sum.
Firm Dissolved or Business Discontinued (Section 189)
Where any business or profession carried on by a firm has been discontinued or where a firm is dissolved, the
assessment of the total income of the firm shall be made as if no such discontinuance or dissolution had taken
place and all the provisions of the Act, including the provisions relating to penalty or any other sum (interest, fine)
chargeable under the Act, shall apply. Consequently, every person who was a partner of the firm at the time of
discontinuance of business or dissolution of the firm and legal representative of the deceased partner shall be
jointly and severally liable to the amount of tax penalty and any other sum. Where the dissolution or discontinuance
of business takes place after any proceedings in respect of an assessment year have commenced, the
proceedings may be continued against the partners or legal representative of a deceased partner from the stage
at which the proceedings stood at the time of such dissolution or discontinuance.
Thus, every partner of the firm and the legal representative of the deceased partner is liable to pay the tax which
is already due or may have become due after the dissolution, irrespective of his interest in the firm. However, if
there was any irrecoverable amount at the time of dissolution or discontinuance of business and later on it was
recovered by the partners, the partners shall personally pay the tax on their share so recovered.

Computation of income on estimated basis in case, taxpayers are engaged in certain business
(Section 44AD)
An assessee being an resident individual, a resident HUF or a resident partnership firm (not being a LLP), who
has not claimed any deduction under Sections 10A, 10AA, 10B, 10BA, 80HH to 80 RRB in the relevant assessment
year is eligible to pay tax on estimated basis.
Further, the assessee should be engaged in any business (whether it is retail trading or wholesale trading or civil
construction or any other business). The turnover/gross receipt of the eligible business shoud not exceed `2
crore during the previous year.
The following persons are not eligible to avail benefit under Section 44AD:
(a) a person carrying on profession as referred to in Section 44AA(1) or
(b) a person earning income in the nature of commission or brokerage or
(c) a person carrying on any agency business or
(d) a person who is in the business of plying, hiring or leasing goods carriages.
If the above conditions are satisfied, the income from eligible business is estimated @ 8% of gross receipt or
total turnover. Further, it is assumed that all the deductions have been allowed and no other deduction is
allowed.

416 EP-TL&P
However, in case of firm, the normal deduction in respect of salary and interest to partners under Section 40(b)
shall no longer be allowed. (w.e.f 1st April, 2016)
Where an eligible assessee declares profit for any previous year in accordance with the provisions of this
section and he declares profit for any of the five assessment years relevant to the previous year succeeding
such previous year not in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (1), he shall not be eligible to claim
the benefit of the provisions of this section for five assessment years subsequent to the assessment year
relevant to the previous year in which the profit has not been declared in accordance with the provisions of
sub-section (1).
Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing provisions of this section, an eligible assessee to whom the
provisions of sub-section (4) are applicable and whose total income exceeds the maximum amount which is not
chargeable to income-tax, shall be required to keep and maintain such books of account and other documents
as required under sub-section (2) of section 44AA and get them audited and furnish a report of such audit as
required under section 44AB.

PRESUMPTIVE TAXATION FOR PROFESSIONALS [SECTION 44ADA INSERTED VIDE FINANCE
ACT, 2016 W.E.F ASSESMENT YEAR 2017-2018]
The existing scheme of taxation provides for a simplified presumptive taxation scheme for certain eligible persons
engaged in certain eligible business only and not for persons earning professional income. In order to rationalize
the presumptive taxation scheme and to reduce the compliance burden of the small tax payers having income
from profession and to facilitate the ease of doing business, a new section 44ADA has been inserted to provide
presumptive taxation regime for professionals.
– New Section 44ADA has been inserted to provide for estimating the income of an assessee (individual,
HUF, partnership firm but not limited liability partnership firms) engaged in any profession referred in
section 44AA(1) such as legal, medical, engineering or architectural, accountancy, technical consultancy,
interior decoration or any other profession as is notified by the Board.
– Total Gross receipts should not exceed Rs. 50 lakhs.
– Income shall be estimated @ 50% of the total gross receipts.
– Deductions u/s 30 to 38 deemed to have been allowed (Including interest and remuneration to partners
in case of partnership firm)
– Assessee is not be required to maintain books of accounts u/s 44AA and gets the accounts audited u/s
44AB unless it claims that the profit and gains from the profession is lower than the deemed profit and
gains and its income exceeds the maximum amount which is not chargeable to income tax.
This amendment effective from 1st April, 2017 and accordingly apply in relation to assessment year
2017-18 and subsequent assessment years.
Other Provisions relating to Limited Liability Partnership:
(1) Transfer of capital asset or intangible asset by a private Limited company or a non-listed company to
Limited Liability Partnership and correspondingly any transfer of a share or shares held in a company
by a shareholder shall not be treated as transfer:
Any transfer of a capital asset or intangible asset by a private company or unlisted public company (hereafter
in this clause referred to as the company) to a limited liability partnership or any transfer of a share or
shares held in the company by a shareholder as a result of conversion of the company into a limited liability
partnership in accordance with the provisions of section 56 or section 57 of the Limited Liability Partnership
Act, 2008 shall not be treated as transfer for the purpose of capital gain under section 45 subject to the
following conditions:

Lesson 7 Computation of Tax Liability of HUF/ Firm/Association of Persons/Co-operative Societies 417
(a) all the assets and liabilities of the company immediately before the conversion become the assets and
liabilities of the limited liability partnership;
(b) all the shareholders of the company immediately before the conversion become the partners of
the limited liability partnership and their capital contribution and profit sharing ratio in the limited
liability partnership are in the same proportion as their shareholding in the company on the date of
conversion;
(c) the shareholders of the company do not receive any consideration or benefit, directly or indirectly, in any
form or manner, other than by way of share in profit and capital contribution in the limited liability
partnership;
(d) the aggregate of the profit sharing ratio of the shareholders of the company in the limited liability
partnership shall not be less than fifty per cent at any time during the period of five years from the date
of conversion;
(e) the total sales, turnover or gross receipts in the business of the company in any of the three previous
years preceding the previous year in which the conversion takes place does not exceed sixty lakh
rupees; and
(ea) the total value of the assets as appearing in the books of account of the company in any of the three
previous years preceding the previous year in which the conversion takes place does not exceed five
crore rupees; (inserted vide Finance Act, 2016 w.e.f. 1st April, 2016) and
(f) no amount is paid, either directly or indirectly, to any partner out of balance of accumulated profit standing
in the accounts of the company on the date of conversion for a period of three years from the date of
conversion.
(2) Consequential amendments due to conversion of a private limited company or a non-listed company
into LLP:
(i) Allowability of depreciation: Aggregate deduction, in respect of depreciation of buildings, machinery,
plant or furniture, being tangible assets or know-how, patents, copyrights, trademarks, licences,
franchises or any other business or commercial rights of similar nature, being intangible assets allowable
to the predecessor and the successor in the case of succession of company into LLP, shall not exceed
in any previous year the deduction calculated at the prescribed rates as if the succession, had not
taken place.
(ii) Successor LLP will be allowed deduction of payment under Voluntary Retirement Scheme for
the unexpired period: Where a private company or unlisted public company is succeeded by a
limited liability partnership fulfilling the conditions laid down in the proviso to clause (xiiib) of section
47, the provisions of this section shall, as far as may be, apply to the successor limited liability
partnership, as they would have applied to the said company, if reorganisation of business had not
taken place.]
(iii) Cost of Acquisition of the asset in case the predecessor company has claimed deduction under section
35AD shall be taken to be nil in the hands of LLP.
(iv) Actual cost of the block of the asset in the hand of successor LLP:
Where in any previous year, any block of assets is transferred by a private company or unlisted public
company to a limited liability partnership and the conditions specified in the proviso to clause (xiiib) of
section 47 are satisfied, then, notwithstanding anything contained in clause (1), the actual cost of the
block of assets in the case of the limited liability partnership shall be the written down value of the block
of assets as in the case of the said company on the date of conversion of the company into the limited
liability partnership.

418 EP-TL&P
(v) Carry Forward and set off of losses (Section 72A(6A):
Where there has been reorganisation of business whereby a private company or unlisted public
company is succeeded by a limited liability partnership fulfilling the conditions laid down in the proviso
to clause (xiiib) of section 47, then, notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this
Act, the accumulated loss and the unabsorbed depreciation of the predecessor company, shall be
deemed to be the loss or allowance for depreciation of the successor limited liability partnership for
the purpose of the previous year in which business reorganisation was effected and other provisions
of this Act relating to set off and carry forward of loss and allowance for depreciation shall apply
accordingly.
However, if any of the conditions laid down in the proviso to clause (xiiib) of section 47 are not complied
with, the set off of loss or allowance of depreciation made in any previous year in the hands of the
successor limited liability partnership, shall be deemed to be the income of the limited liability partnership
chargeable to tax in the year in which such conditions are not complied with.
“Accumulated loss” means so much of the loss of the predecessor firm or the proprietary concern
or the private company or unlisted public company before conversion into limited liability partnership
or the amalgamating company or the demerged company, as the case may be, under the head “Profits
and gains of business or profession” (not being a loss sustained in a speculation business) which
such predecessor firm or the proprietary concern or the company or amalgamating company or
demerged company, would have been entitled to carry forward and set off under the provisions of
section 72 if the reorganisation of business or conversion or amalgamation or demerger had not
taken place.
“Unabsorbed depreciation” means so much of the allowance for depreciation of the predecessor firm
or the proprietary concern or the private company or unlisted public company before conversion into
limited liability partnership or the amalgamating company or the demerged company, as the case may
be, which remains to be allowed and which would have been allowed to the predecessor firm or the
proprietary concern or the company or amalgamating company or demerged company, as the case
may be, under the provisions of this Act, if the reorganisation of business or conversion or amalgamation
or demerger had not taken place.
(vi) MAT credit of the predecessor company will lapse.

Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT) (Section 115JC)
Where the regular income tax payable for a previous year by a person other than a company is less than the
alternate minimum tax payable for such previous year then the adjusted total income shall deemed to be the
total income of that person for such previous year and it shall be liable to pay income tax on such adjusted total
income @ 18.5% plus education & SHEC @ 3%.
Upto Assessment Year 2012-13, Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT) was levied on limited liability partnerships (LLPs).
However, no such tax was levied on the other form of business organisations such as partnership firms, sole
proprietorship, association of persons, etc. In order to widen the tax base vis-à-vis profit linked deductions, the
provisions regarding AMT has been broaden to cover all persons other than a company, who has claimed
deduction under any section (other than section 80P) included in Chapter VI-A under the heading “C – Deductions
in respect of certain incomes” or under section 10AA, shall be liable to pay AMT.
Accordingly, where the regular income-tax payable for a previous year by a person (other than a company) is
less than the alternate minimum tax payable for such previous year, the adjusted total income shall be deemed
to be the total income of such person and he shall be liable to pay income-tax on such total income at the rate of
eighteen and one-half per cent.

Lesson 7 Computation of Tax Liability of HUF/ Firm/Association of Persons/Co-operative Societies 419
For the purpose of the above,
(i) “adjusted total income” shall be the total income before giving effect to provisions of Chapter XII-BA as
increased by the deductions claimed under any section (other than section 80P) included in Chapter VI-A
under the heading “C – Deductions in respect of certain incomes” and deduction claimed under section
10AA;
(ii) “alternate minimum tax:” shall be the amount of tax computed on adjusted total income at a rate of
eighteen and one half per cent; and
(iii) “regular income-tax” shall be the income-tax payable for a previous year by a person other than a
company on his total income in accordance with the provisions of the Act other than the provisions of
Chapter XII-BA.
Section 115JC is amended by Finance Act 2014, so as to provide that total income shall be increased by the
deduction claimed under section 35AD for purpose of computation of adjusted total income. The amount of
depreciation allowable under section 32 shall, however, be reduced in computing the adjusted total income.
It is further provided that the provisions of AMT under Chapter XII-BA shall not apply to an individual or a Hindu
undivided family or an association of persons or a body of individuals (whether incorporated or not) or an
artificial juridical person referred to in section 2(31)(vii) if the adjusted total income of such person does not
exceed twenty lakh rupees.
It is also provided that the credit for tax (tax credit) paid by a person on account of AMT under Chapter XIIBA shall be allowed to the extent of the excess of the AMT paid over the regular income-tax. This tax credit
shall be allowed to be carried forward up to the tenth assessment year immediately succeeding the
assessment year for which such credit becomes allowable. It shall be allowed to be set off for an assessment
year in which the regular income-tax exceeds the AMT to the extent of the excess of the regular income-tax
over the AMT.
The existing provisions of sub-section (1) of section 115JEE provide that the provisions of Chapter-XII BA
shall be applicable to any person who has claimed a deduction under part C of Chapter VI-A or claimed a
deduction u/s 10AA. Further the present provisions of sub-section (2) of section 115JEE provide that the
Chapter shall not be applicable to an individual or an HUF or an association of persons or a body of individuals
(whether incorporated or not) or an artificial juridical person if the adjusted total income does not exceed
twenty lakh rupees. This has created difficulty in claim of credit of alternate minimum tax under section 115JD
in an assessment year where the income is not more than twenty lakh rupees or there is no claim of any
deduction under section 10AA or Chapter VI-A. With a view to enable an assessee who has paid alternate
minimum tax in any earlier previous year to claim credit of the same, in any subsequent year, this section is
amended by Finance Act 2014, so as to provide that the credit for tax paid under section115JC shall be
allowed in accordance with the provisions of section 115JD, notwithstanding the conditions mentioned in
sub-section (1) or (2) of section 115JEE.
Every person to which this section applies shall obtain a report, in such form as may be prescribed from an
accountant certifying that the adjusted total income and the alternate minimum tax have been computed in
accordance with the provisions of this Chapter and furnish such report on or before the due date of filing of
return under sub-section (1) of section 139.

TAXATION OF ASSOCIATION OF PERSONS
‘Association of persons’ has not been defined in the Income-tax Act. However in the case of CIT v. Indira
Balkrishna [(1960) 39 ITR 546] the Supreme Court has defined it as:
“Association of persons” means an association in which two or more persons join in for a common
purpose or common action to produce income, profits or gains.
An association of persons may consist of non-individuals (Companies, firms joint families) [Ipoth v. CIT (1968)
67 ITR 106 (S.C.)]. A minor can join an AOP if his lawful guardian gives his consent. [Murugesan & Bros. v. CIT
(1973) 88 ITR 432 (SC)].
Applying the ratio laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of G. Murugesan and Bros. v. Commissioner of

Lesson 7 Computation of Tax Liability of HUF/ Firm/Association of Persons/Co-operative Societies 423
Income-tax (1973, 88 ITR 432), the Kerala High Court held in the case of Commissioner of Income-tax v. Goel
C. Dalal and Perin C. Dalal (1990, 184 ITR 248) that in order to acquire the status of an association of persons,
the persons must join in a common purpose or action and the object of the association must be to produce
income. It is not enough that the persons receive the income jointly.

Formation of an Association of Persons
For the formation of an AOP the association need not necessarily be on the basis of a contract, consent and
understanding may be presumed [Shanmugham & Co. v. CIT (1971) 81 ITR 310 (S.C.)].
Applying the ratio laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of N.V. Shanmugham & Co. v. Commissioner of
Income-tax (1971, 81 ITR 310) the Calcutta High Court held in the case of Gopal Chand Sen v. Income-tax
Officer and others (1977, 109 ITR 820) that an assessment of business income has to be done in the hands of
receivers and in such an assessment, the receivers are never assessed as independent earners of income. The
income in the hands of the receiver is assessable in the like manner and to the same extent as it would have
been assessed on the real owners.
However, co-owners, co-heirs or co-legatees do not constitute an AOP in respect of the income of the joint or
common asset by reason only of their jural relationship. But if they write themselves with the objective of
earning income they constitute an AOP for assessment purposes. [Estate of Mohamed Rowther v. CIT (1963, 49
ITR 39)]. Section 26 of the Income-tax Act provides that where property consisting of building or buildings and
lands appurtenant thereto is owned by two or more persons in definite and ascertainable shares, such persons
shall not, in respect of such property be assessed as an AOP, but on their respective share of income therefrom.
In order to constitute an association of persons, there must be joining together in a common purpose or in
a common action, the object of which is to produce income, profits and gains. Though a body of individuals is
not identical with an association of persons, they have some similarities. An association of persons may consist
of non-individuals also but a body of individuals has to consist only of human beings. The word ‘body’ would
require an association for some common purpose or for a common cause or there must be unity under some
common tie or occupation. A mere collection of individuals without a common tie or common aid cannot be
taken to be a body of individuals failing under Section 2(31) of the Income-tax Act, 1961. [See CIT v. Deghamwala
Estates (1980, 121 ITR 684)].

Tax Liability of Association of Persons
With effect from assessment year 1989-90, the following provisions are applicable to assessees other than
companies, co-operative societies and societies registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 or any
law corresponding to that Act in force in any part of India.
(1) Interest paid by the AOP to a member will not be allowed as a deduction from the income of the Association
of Persons [Section 40(ba)].
In cases where interest is paid by the AOP to any member, who has also paid interest to the AOP, the net
amount of interest that will be disallowed is the amount of interest paid by the AOP to the member less
the amount of interest paid to the AOP by the member [Explanation 1 to Section 40(ba)].
(2) In cases where an individual is a member of an AOP in a representative capacity, any interest paid by
the AOP to such individual or by such individual to the AOP, otherwise than in a representative capacity
will not be subject to disallowance under explanation 2(i) to Section 40(ba).
(3) In the cases of interest paid by AOP to such individual or by such individual to the AOP in a representative
capacity any interest paid by the AOP to the person represented by such person or vice versa, will not
be allowed under Section 40(ba) [Explanation 2(ii) to Section 40(ba)].
(4) Explanation 3 to Section 40(ba) further provides that where an individual is a member of the AOP

424 EP-TL&P
otherwise than as member in a representative capacity, any interest paid by the AOP to such individual
will not be disallowed if the interest is received by him on behalf of any other person.
(5) Any salary, bonus, commission or remuneration (by whatever name called) paid by the AOP to a member
will not be allowed as a deduction.
Section 167B makes the following provisions as regards the incidence of charge of tax on the association of
persons.
A. Where shares of members are determinate
In this case, tax is chargeable on the income of the association of persons at the same rate as applicable to an
individual. However, where the total income of any member of the association of persons for the previous year
(excluding his share of income from the association of persons) exceeds the maximum amount not chargeable
to tax in the case of an individual, tax will be charged on the total income of the AOP at the maximum marginal
rate of 30%, i.e. the highest slab applicable to an individual.
More so, where the total income of any member of the AOP, irrespective of whether or not it exceeds the
maximum amount not chargeable to tax in the case of an individual, is chargeable to tax at a rate higher than the
maximum marginal rate, tax will be charged on the total income of the AOP at such higher rate.
B. Where the shares of the members are indeterminate
In these cases, tax will be charged on the total income of the AOP at the maximum marginal rate, that is, the rate
of tax as well as surcharge, if any, applicable to the highest slab of income in the case of an individual as
specified in the Finance Act of the relevant year.
The individual shares of the members in the whole or any part of the income of the AOP will be deemed to be
indeterminate or unknown if such shares are indeterminate or unknown on the date of formation of the AOP, or
at any time thereafter.

Method of Computing Share of a Member of Association of Persons, etc. (Section 67A)
Section 67A seeks to provide for the method of computing a member’s share in the income of an association of
persons or a body of individuals, wherein the shares of the members are determinate, in the same manner
as provided for in Sub-sections (1) to (3) of Section 67 for computing a partner’s share in a firm.
This section lays down the following methods of computing the member’s share:
(a) Any interest, salary, bonus, commission or remuneration, by whatever name called, paid to any member
in respect of the previous year shall be deducted from the total income of the association or body and
the balance ascertained and apportioned among the members in the proportion in which they are entitled
to share the income of the association or body.
(b) Where the amount apportioned to a member under (a) hereinabove is a profit, any interest, salary,
bonus, commission or remuneration paid to the member by the AOP in respect of the previous year
shall be added to that amount - the result shall constitute the member’s share in the income of the
association or body.
(c) Where the amount apportioned to a member under (a) is a loss, any interest, salary, bonus, commission
or remuneration aforesaid paid to the member by the association or body in respect of the previous year
shall be adjusted against that amount, the result shall be adjusted against that amount, and the result
shall be treated as the member’s share in the income of the association or body.

23.1.1990 [(1990, 183 ITR 1 (SC)].

Lesson 7 Computation of Tax Liability of HUF/ Firm/Association of Persons/Co-operative Societies 425
Tax on Income of association of persons, etc. which is indeterminate or unknown (New Section 167B)
Section 167B seeks to provide that where the individual shares of the members of an association or body in the
whole or any part of the income of such association or body are indeterminate or unknown, tax shall be charged
on the total income of the association or body at the maximum marginal rate. However, where the total income
of any member of such association or body is chargeable to tax at a rate which is higher than the maximum
marginal rate, tax shall be charged on the total income of the association or body at such higher rate. Also,
where the total income of any member of an association of persons or body of individuals as above for the
previous year (excluding his share from such association or body) exceeds the maximum amount which is not
chargeable to tax in the case of that member, tax shall be charged on the total income of the association or body
at the maximum marginal rate. However, where any member or members of such association or body of
individuals is or are chargeable to tax for the previous year at a rate or rates which is or are higher than the
maximum marginal rate, tax shall be charged on that portion or portions of the total income of the association or
body of individuals which is or are relatable to the share or shares of such member or members at such higher
rate or rates, as the case may be, and the balance of the total income the association or body shall be taxed at
the maximum marginal rate.
In the explanation to the above provisions, it is provided that the shares of the members of an association or
body in the whole or any part of the income of such association or body shall be deemed to be indeterminate or
unknown if such shares (in relation to the whole or any part of such income) are indeterminate or unknown on
the date of formation of such association or body or any time thereafter.
Share of a member of association etc. (Section 86)
Section 86 relates to shares of members of an association of persons or a body of individuals in the income of
the association or body. This section provides that if the assessee is a member of an association of persons or
a body of individuals (other than a company or a Co-operative society or a Society registered under the Societies
Registration Act, 1860, or any law corresponding to that Act in force in any part of India), his share in the income
of the association or body, computed in the manner provided in Section 67A shall not be liable to tax.
Further, where the association or body is chargeable to tax on its total income at the maximum marginal rate or
any higher rate, under any of the provisions of the Income-tax Act, his share computed in the manner stated
above shall not be included in his total income.
But, in other cases and in cases where no income-tax is chargeable on the total income of the association or
body, the member’s share shall be chargeable to tax as part of his total income and Section 86 shall not be
applicable to such case.
The charge of tax on the member’s share in AOP will depend on the following factors:
(i) Income-tax is not payable by the member in respect of his share in the income of the AOP, computed in
the manner provided in Section 67A.
(ii) His share in the income of the AOP is includible in his total income for rate purposes.
(iii) Where the AOP is chargeable to tax on its total income at the ‘maximum marginal rate’ or at any higher
rate, the share of the member will not be includible in his total income. In this case, the member’s share
in the income of the AOP will not be included in his income even for rate purposes.
(iv) In any other case, the member’s share will form part of his total income.
(v) Where no income-tax is chargeable on the total income of the AOP, the share of the member will be
chargeable to tax part of his total income. Section 86 will not be applicable to such cases.

426 EP-TL&P

Assessment in case of Dissolution of an Association of Persons (Section 177)
Where any business or profession carried on by an AOP has been discontinued or an AOP is dissolved, the
Assessing Officer shall make an assessment of the total income of the AOP as if no such discontinuance or
dissolution had taken place, and all provisions of this Act, including the provisions relating to the levy of penalty
or any other sum chargeable under any provisions of the Income-tax Act shall apply.
Every person who was at the time of such discontinuance or dissolution a member of the AOP and the legal
representative of any such person who is deceased, shall jointly and severally be liable for the amount of tax,
penalty or other sum payable.
Where such discontinuance or dissolution takes place after any proceeding in respect of an assessment year
have commenced, the proceedings may be continued against the members from the stage at which the
proceedings stood at the time of such discontinuance or dissolution.

TAXATION OF CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES
Meaning [Section 2(10)]
‘Co-operative Society’ means a co-operative society registered under the Co-operative Societies Act, 1912, or
under any other law for the time being in force in any State for the registration of co-operative societies.
A regional rural bank (to which provisions of the Regional Rural Bank Act, 1976, apply) is deemed to be a cooperative society [Circular No. 319 dated 11.1.1982].

Computation of Income of Co-operative Societies
The income of a co-operative society is computed in the same manner as provided for other assessees. Further,
the subsidy given by the government to a co-operative society for meeting managerial expenses and admission
fee collected by the society is treated as revenue receipt and liable to tax. [Ludhiana Central Co-operative
Consumers’ Stores Ltd. v. C.I.T. (1980) 122, I.T.R. 942].
There is, however difference of opinion with regard to tax treatment of ‘subsidy’ received from the Government.
Distinguishing the ratio laid down by the Punjab & Haryana High Court in the case of Ludhiana Central Cooperative Consumers’ Stores Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1980, 122 ITR 942), the Punjab & Haryana
High Court held in the case of Commissioner of Income-tax v. Jindal Brothers Rice Mills (1989, 179 ITR 470)
that depreciation is allowable on the cost of the machinery or plant reduced by the amount of the subsidy as
actual cost stands reduced by the percentage allowed by the subsidy. Though this case was followed by it in the
case of Commissioner of Income-tax v. Janak Steel Tubes (Pvt.) Ltd. (1989, 179 ITR 536) (the capital subsidy
should be deducted from the value of plant and machinery) but had been dissented from by the Bombay,
Madras and Rajasthan High Courts in the following cases:
(i) Srinivas Industries v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1991, 188 ITR 22): The Madras High Court held
that the subsidy really partook the character of cash grant expendable for any purpose-consequently,
the amount of subsidy granted could not be deducted from the capital cost of the machinery.
(ii) In Commissioner of Income-tax v. Elys Plastics Pvt. Ltd. (1991, 188 ITR 11) the Bombay High Court
held that the subsidies were not deductible in computing the cost of plant and machinery for purposes
of allowing depreciation.
(iii) In Commissioner of Income-tax v. Ambica Electrolytic Capacitors (P) Ltd. and others (1991, 191
ITR 494) the Rajasthan High Court held that the subsidy or investment subsidy given by the Government
cannot be deducted from the actual cost for purposes of investment or depreciation allowance.
A co-operative society is entitled to the deductions from its gross total income under Sections 80G, 80GGA,
80GGC, 80-IA, 80-IB, 80JJA and 80P.

Lesson 7 Computation of Tax Liability of HUF/ Firm/Association of Persons/Co-operative Societies 427

Deduction in respect of income of co-operative societies (Section 80P)
Section 80P provides for certain deductions from the gross total income of a Co-operative Society. These
deductions are:
(a) In the case of Co-operative Society engaged in:

(v) the processing, without the aid of power, of the agricultural produce of its members, or
(vi) the collective disposal of the labour of its members, or
(vii) fishing or allied activities, i.e., catching, curing, processing, preserving, storing or marketing of fish
or the purchase of materials and equipment in connection therewith for the purpose of supplying
them to its members,
the whole of the amount of profits and gains of business attributable to any one or more of such activities shall
be deducted from the gross total income provided that in the case of a co-operative society falling under Subclause (vi) or (vii), the rules and bye-laws of the society restrict the voting rights to the following classes of its
members:
(i) the individuals who contribute their labour or carry on the fishing or allied activities;
(ii) the co-operative credit societies which provide financial assistance to the society;
(iii) the State Government.
(b) In the case of primary co-operative society engaged in supplying milk, oilseeds, fruits, vegetables raised or
grown by its members to

(ii) a Government or a local authority; or
(iii) a Government Company or a Corporation established by or under a Central, State or a Provincial Act
(being a company or corporation engaged in supplying the above mentioned products to the public).
the whole of the amount of profits and gains of such business shall be deducted from the gross total income.
In the case of a co-operative society engaged in activities other than those specified in clauses (a) or (b) either
independently of, or in addition to, profits and gains attributable to the activities mentioned at clauses (a) and (b)
deduction from the gross total income will be allowed to the extent of ` 50,000 w.e.f. assessment year 19992000.
(c) Where such co-operative society is a Consumers’ Co-operative Society, the deduction shall be ` 1,00,000
w.e.f. assessment year 1999-2000.
(d) In the case of every co-operative society, the whole of the income by way of interest or dividends derived
from its investments with any other co-operative society shall be deducted from the gross total income.
(e) In the case of every co-operative society, the whole of the income derived by the society from the letting of
godowns or warehouses for storage, processing or facilitating the marketing of commodities shall be deducted
from its gross total income.

428 EP-TL&P
(f) In the case of every co-operative society, not being a housing society or an urban consumers’ society, or a
society carrying on transport business or a society engaged in the performance of any manufacturing operations
with the aid of power, where the gross total income does not exceed ` 20,000 the amount of any income by way
of interest on securities or any income from house property shall be deducted from the gross total income.
Urban Consumers’ Co-operative Society
An urban consumers’ co-operative society means a society for the benefit of consumers, within the limits of a
municipal corporation, municipality, notified areas committee, town area or, cantonment [Explanation to Section
80P(2)].
The provisions of this Section shall not apply in relation to any cooperative bank other than a primary agricultural
credit society or a primary cooperative agricultural and rural development bank.

Assessment of Co-operative Societies
The following are the provisions which are specifically applicable to the assessment of Co-operative Societies I. Co-operative Housing Society. Under Section 27(iii), a member of co-operative society, company or other
association of persons to whom a building or part thereof is allotted or leased under a house building scheme of the
society, company or association, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be owner of that building or part thereof.
Clause (iiia) further provides that a person who is allowed to take or retain possession of any building or part
thereof in part performance of a contract of the nature referred to in Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act,
1882 shall be deemed to be the owner of that building or part thereof; and
As per Clause (iiib), a person who acquires any rights (excluding any rights by way of a lease from month to
month or for a period not exceeding one year) in or with respect to any building or part thereof, by virtue of any
such transaction as is referred to in Clause (f) of Section 269UA, shall be deemed to be the owner of that
building or part thereof.
Clause (f) of Section 269UA, it may be noted, defines “transfer” for the purposes of Chapter XX-C of the Incometax Act, dealing with purchase by Central Government of immovable properties in certain cases of transfer.
II. Profits and Gains of Co-operative Society from insurance business (Section 44). The profits and
gains of any business of insurance carried on by a Co-operative Society shall be computed in accordance with
the rules contained in the First Schedule.
In this connection, the First Schedule and Rule 6E of the Income-tax Rules, 1962 provides as under:
The profits of non-life insurance business, e.g., Fire insurance business, marine insurance business, general
insurance business etc. shall be the profits disclosed by the annual accounts required to be prepared under the
Insurance Act, 1938 subject to the following adjustments:
(i) If such profits are arrived at after deducting any expenditure or allowance which is not admissible under
Sections 30 to 43B of the Income-tax Act, such expenditure or allowance shall be added back to the
profits.
(ii) The reserve for unexpired risks shall be allowed as a deduction to the following extent:
(a) where the insurance business relates to fire insurance or miscellaneous insurance - 50% of the net
premium income of such business of the previous year;
(b) where the insurance business relates to marine insurance, 100% of the net premium income of
such business of the previous year.
‘Net premium income’ means the amount of premium received, as reduced by the amount of re-insurance
premiums paid during the relevant previous year.

Lesson 7 Computation of Tax Liability of HUF/ Firm/Association of Persons/Co-operative Societies 429
In the context of computing the total income of co-operative society, the following cases are worth noting.
(1) Where the credit facility is extended to members of the society by virtue of sale of goods to them by consumers’
co-operative society, the exemption is not available. When the society sells goods on credit to its members,
such transaction cannot be construed as a credit society to which the benefit of Section 80P(2)(a)(i) can be
extended. [Rodier Mill Employees’ Co-operative Stores Ltd. v. CIT (1982) 135 ITR 355].
Following the ratio laid down by the Madras High Court in the case of Rodier Mill Employees’ Co-operative
Stores Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1982, 135 ITR 355), the Kerala High Court held in the case of Kerala
Co-operative Consumers Federation Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1988, 170 ITR 455) that the words
‘providing credit facilities’, occurring in Section 80P(2)(a)(i) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 should be construed as
similar to, or akin to the ‘carrying on the business of banking’, preceding the words “or providing credit facilities”
in the same sub-section. The words ‘providing credit facilities to its members’ means providing credit by way of
loans and not selling goods on credit.
(2) Where society purchases auto-rickshaws and sells them to members on hire-purchase, it is not providing
credit facility to members and not entitled to exemption [C.I.T. v. Madras Auto Rickshaw Drivers’ Co-operative
Society (1983) 143 ITR 981]. In this case it was held that the tax relief under Section 80P(2)(a)(i) of the Incometax Act, is a grant not to a category of income but to a category of assessees namely, a co-operative society
answering the description of a society engaged in carrying on the business of providing credit facilities to its
members. If the society in question does not answer to this description, it is not entitled to the relief.
(3) In Bihar State Co-operative Bank Ltd. v. C.I.T. [(1960) 39 I.T.R. 114] the Supreme Court has held that if a
co-operative society carrying on banking business invests its circulating capital in such a manner that it is readily
available, the interest on such investment shall constitute income from banking business and therefore shall be
exempt in the hands of the co-operative society.
(4) Interest received on Government Securities held by co-operative society as its stock-in-trade qualifies for
deduction from gross total income. But the deduction is inapplicable to interest received from Government
Securities held as investments. [CIT v. Bombay State Co-operative Bank Ltd. (1968) 70 ITR 86 (S.C.)].
The Madhya Pradesh High Court held in the case of M.P. State Co-operative Bank Ltd. v. Addl. Commissioner of
Income-tax (1979, 119 ITR 327) that income from investment of reserve capital in securities was not a part of the
income from banking business and did not qualify for exemption. Similarly, the interest income from investment
of provident fund income did not form part of the income from the banking business and did not qualify for
exemption under Section 80(i)(a) (now Section 80P). Distinguishing the ratio laid down in this case, the Madhya
Pradesh High Court held in the case of Commissioner of Income-tax v. Bhopal Co-operative Central Bank Ltd.
(1987, 164 ITR 713) that the security deposits made are in accordance with the Banking Regulation Act, 1949
and interest income received on deposits formed part of income from business of banking and exempt under
Section 80P(2)(i) of the Income-tax Act, 1961.
The Allahabad High Court held in the case of Addl. Commissioner of Income-tax v. U.P. Co-operative Cane Union
(1978, 114 ITR 70) that selling goods on credit was only a mode of carrying on business. It did not become a
business of providing credit facility. Following this case, the Allahabad High Court held in the case of Commissioner
of Income-tax v. U.P. Co-operative Cane Union Federation Ltd. (1980, 122 ITR 913) that the expression ‘providing
credit facilities’ in Section 80P(2)(a)(i) would comprehend the business of lending money on interest. It would also
comprehend the business of lending services on profit for guaranteeing payments because guaranteeing payment
is as much a part of banking business for affording credit facility as advancing loans.
However, where a co-operative society holds securities as per requirements of Banking Regulation Act and
directions of the RBI, the deduction is available on such interest income. Similarly, subsidy from Government for
opening new branches and giving loans to poorer sections at lower rate of interest, is income attributable to
banking business [CIT v. Madurai District Central Co-operative Bank Ltd. (1984) 148 ITR 196].

430 EP-TL&P
(5) The Income earned by a co-operative society carrying on the business of banking and providing credit
facilities to its members from commission and brokerage by dealing in bills of exchange, subsidy from Government,
admission fee from members, incidental charges and financial penalties is attributable to the business of banking
of providing credit facilities to its members and hence deductible under Section 80P(2)(a)(i) [CIT v. Dhar
Central Co-operative Bank (1984) 149 ITR 438 (MP)].
Following its decision in the case of Commissioner of Income-tax v. Dhar Central Co-operative Bank (1984, 149
ITR 438), the Madhya Pradesh High Court held in the case of Commissioner of Income-tax v. Bhopal Cooperative Central Bank Ltd. (1988, 172 ITR 423) that a co-operative society carrying on the business of banking
is entitled to exemption in respect of interest on securities, commission, subsidy, donation and locker rent.
Again, the said decision was followed by it in the case of Madhya Pradesh Rajya Sahakari Bank v. Commissioner
of Income-tax (1988, 174 ITR 150) holding that the income from commission, exchange and other miscellaneous
income was attributable to the business of banking and that the assessee was entitled to exemption under
Section 81 (now 80P) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 in respect thereof.
(6) A society which buys and sells products of other societies or individuals is not entitled to exemption. Where
a society manufactures and sells its own products or the products of its members, such society is entitled to
exemption. Hence, the Central Cottage Industries Emporium, New Delhi, is not entitled to exemption under
Section 80P [Addl. C.I.T. v. Indian Co-operative Union Ltd. (1982) 134 ITR 108 (Delhi)].
If the godown or warehouse is let for a purpose other than storage, processing of facilitating the marketing of
commodities, the income derived therefrom by a co-operative society would not be deductible under Section
80P C.I.T. v. Ahmedabad Maskati Cloth Dealers Co-operative Warehouses Society Ltd. [(1986) 162 ITR 142
(Guj.)] it was also held in this case that shops in which wholesale or retail business in cloth is carried on cannot
come within the meaning of ‘godowns’ or ‘warehouses’.
The Gujarat High Court’s decision in the case of Commissioner of Income-tax v. Ahmedabad Maskati Cloth
Dealers Co-operative Warehouses Society Ltd. (1986, 162 ITR 142) had since been approved by the
Supreme Court in the case of South Arcot District Co-operative Marketing Society Ltd. (infra). The Gujarat High
Court had, inter alia, held that the words facilitating the marketing of commodities’ would not lend colour to the
words ‘godowns or warehouses’ so as to enlarge their meaning.

Income of co-operative societies (Section 80P)
Amount received for letting of godowns, incidental services of taking delivery of stock at rail-head and transporting
it to godowns were also rendered and amount received was described as ‘commission’ was wholly exemption
C.I.T. v. South Arcot District Co-operative Marketing Society Ltd. (1989) 43 Taxman 328/176 ITR 117 (SC).
Income from ginning and pressing of cotton is exempt. Broach Distt. Co-operative Cotton Sales, Ginning &
Pressing Society Ltd. v. CIT (1989) 177 ITR 418/44 Taxman 439 (SC).
Where assessee, an apex co-operative society, derived (i) interest on cash security furnished by it for carrying
on sugar agency business, and (ii) interest on temporary loans given by it for financing sugar business, while
former interest was not exempt, latter was exempt under Section 14(3)(iii) of the 1922 Act, CIT v. U.P. Cooperative Federation Ltd. (1989) 176 ITR 435/43 Taxman 20 (SC).
Amount of subsidy received by assessee from National Co-operative Development Corpn. towards loss incurred
on account of price fluctuation qualifies for deduction under Section 81(1)(c) - CIT v. Punjab State Co-operative
Supply & Marketing Federation Ltd. (1989) 46 Taxman 156 (Punj. & Har.).
Proportionate expenditure relating to such business activities of assessee co-operative society as are
contemplated by Section 80P(2) is not to be disallowed. Baghapurana Co-operative Marketing Society Ltd. v.
CIT (1989) 178 ITR, 653/44 Taxman 92 (Punj. & Har.).
In the cases of agricultural produce, the agricultural produce marketed by assessee co-operative society need

Lesson 7 Computation of Tax Liability of HUF/ Firm/Association of Persons/Co-operative Societies 431
not have been produced by assessee’s members - CIT v. Punjab State Co-operative Supply & Marketing
Federation Ltd. (1989) 46 Taxman 156 (Punj. & Har.).
The expression ‘the marketing of the agricultural produce of its members means that agricultural produce should
be owned by its members, whether supplied by them (that is, the members) or purchased from the market or
acquired from any other producer. C.I.T. v. Haryana State Co-operative Supply & Marketing Federation Ltd.
(1989) 79 CTR (Punj. & Har.) 94.
Short-term call deposits are investment within the meaning of Section 80P(2)(d) CIT v. Haryana Co-operative
Sugar Mills Ltd. (1989) 46 Taxman 28 (Punj. & Har.).

(2) The gross total income of the society exceeds ` 20,000 hence deduction regarding income from house
property is not available.

TONNAGE TAX SCHEME [SECTIONS 115V TO 115VZC]
To make the Indian shipping industry more competitive, a tonnage tax scheme for taxation of shipping profits
has been introduced. Many maritime nations have introduced tonnage based taxation. Some of the basic features
of the tonnage tax scheme are as follows:
– It is a scheme of presumptive taxation whereby the notional income arising from the operation of a ship
is determined based on the tonnage of the ship.
– The notional income is taxed at the normal corporate rate applicable for the year. Tax is payable even if
there is a loss in any year.
– A company may opt for the scheme and once such option is exercised, there is a lock in period of ten
years. If a company opts out, it is debarred from re-entry for next ten years.
– Since this is a preferential regime of taxation, certain conditions like, creation of reserves, training etc.
are required to be met. A company may be expelled in certain circumstances.
– The income is computed under Section 115VG in respect of tonnage capacity of ship multiplied by the
slab rate.

– The term ‘Hindu undivided family’ has not been defined in the Income-tax Act. However, in general
parlance it means an undivided family of Hindus. Creation of a HUF is a God-gifted phenomenon. As
soon as a married Hindu gets a child, a new HUF comes into existence. It is not at all necessary that
every HUF must have joint property or family income.
– A Hindu Joint Family consists of Coparceners & members.
– The gross total income of the family for the relevant previous year shall be computed under the
relevant heads (as per the provisions of the Income-tax Act) as it is computed for other assessees.
– ‘Partition’ signifies division of property. In the cases of property capable of physical division, share of
each member is determined by making physical division thereof. It must be noted that a division of
income without physical division of property does not amount to partition.
– Partnership Firm: Under Section 2(23) of the Income-tax Act, the terms “firm”, “partner”, and
“partnership” have the meanings respectively assigned to them in the Indian Partnership Act, 1932
and Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008.
– As per the scheme, a partnership firm shall be assessed as a firm if the following conditions are
satisfied:

• The partnership is evidenced by an instrument i.e. partnership deed.
• The individual shares of the partners are specified in that instrument.
• A copy of the partnership deed certified by all the partners in writing (other than the minors) is

submitted along with the return of income in respect of which assessment as a firm is first sought.

– As per Section 10(2A) of the Act, any person who is a partner of a firm which is assessed as such, his
share in the total income of the firm will not be included in computing his total income. Partner
includes a minor admitted to the benefits of partnership as per Section 2(23) of the Act.
– When all the partners in the predecessor firm are replaced by new partners in the successor firm, it
is known as succession of one firm by another firm. If a firm is dissolved and some of the partners
take over the firm’s business or carry on a similar business with or without new partners, it would be
a case of succession by a new firm .
– Where a change has occurred in the constitution of a firm on account of death or retirement, the firm
is not entitled to carry forward and set off so much of the loss proportionate to the share of a retired
or deceased partner as exceeds his share of profits, if any, in the firm in respect of the previous year.
– Alternate Minimum Tax: From the assessment year 2012-13 onwards, where the regular income
tax payable for a previous year by a person other than a company is less than the alternate minimum
tax payable for such previous year then the adjusted total income shall deemed to be the total income
such person for such previous year and it shall be liable to pay income tax on such adjusted total
income @ 18.5% plus education & SHEC @ 3%.
– Association of persons: “Association of persons” means an association in which two or more persons
join in a common purpose or common action to produce income, profits or gains.
– For the formation of an AOP the association need not necessarily be on the basis of a contract,
consent and understanding may be presumed.
– Section 167B makes the following provisions as regards the incidence of charge of tax on the
association of persons.

• Where shares of members are determinate In this case, tax is chargeable on the income of the

434 EP-TL&P
association of persons at the same rate as applicable to an individual. However, where the total
income of any member of the association of persons for the previous year (excluding his share of
income from the association of persons) exceeds the maximum amount not chargeable to tax in
the case of an individual, tax will be charged on the total income of the AOP at the maximum
marginal rate of 30%, i.e. the highest slab applicable to an individual.

• Where the shares of the members are indeterminate In these cases, tax will be charged on

the total income of the AOP at the maximum marginal rate, that is, the rate of tax as well as
surcharge, if any, applicable to the highest slab of income in the case of an individual as specified
in the Finance Act of the relevant year

– Section 67A seeks to provide for the method of computing a member’s share in the income of an
association of persons or a body of individuals, wherein the shares of the members are determinate,
in the same manner as provided for in Sub-sections (1) to (3) of Section 67 for computing a partner’s
share in a firm.
– Co-operative Society means a co-operative society registered under the Co-operative Societies
Act, 1912, or under any other law for the time being in force in any State for the registration of cooperative societies.
– The income of a co-operative society is computed in the same manner as provided for other assessees.
– Section 80P provides for certain deductions from the gross total income of a Co-operative Society.
– To make the Indian shipping industry more competitive, a tonnage tax scheme for taxation of shipping
profits has been introduced. Many maritime nations have introduced tonnage based taxation. Under
this scheme, of presumptive taxation whereby the notional income arising from the operation of a
ship is determined based on the tonnage of the ship.

Computation of Tax Liability of Companies
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

LESSON OUTLINE

In the previous lessons we have learn the tax
provisions of persons not being the company.
Here, we will go through the income tax
provisions of corporate. Company is also
defined as person and liable to pay taxes on
the income earned in the previous year. Section
2(17) of the Act, has defined the company as
domestic company and foreign company. Now,
the question arises why the foreign companies
are required to pay tax in India. As it is discussed
in earlier lessons that tax liability is determined
on the basis of residential status and source of
income, therefore the tax liability of company is
also determined on the basis of residency and
source of income accruing or arising in India.

Income tax being direct tax is a major source of revenue for the Central Government. The entire
amount of income tax collected by the Central Government is classified under the head: (a)
Corporation Tax (Tax on the income of the companies) and (b) Income Tax (Tax on income of the
non-corporate assesses).

440 EP-TL&P

CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS
Under the Constitution of India, the legislative fields in entries 85 and 86 of the Union List in the Seventh
Schedule specify Corporation tax and taxes on capital value of the assets, exclusive of agricultural land of
individuals and companies. A tax on capital value of assets is a composite tax on the totality of all the assets
owned by the company.
Article 366(6) of the Constitution defines corporate tax as follows:
Corporate tax means any tax on income, so far as that tax is payable by companies and is a tax in case the
following conditions are fulfilled:
(a) that it is not chargeable in respect of agricultural income;
(b) that no deduction in respect of tax paid by companies is by any enactments which may apply to the tax
authorised to be made from dividends payable by the companies to individuals;
(c) that no provision exists for taking the tax so paid into account for computing for the purposes of Indian
income tax, the total income of individuals receiving such dividends, or in computing the Indian income
tax payable by, or refundable to, such individuals.

MEANING OF COMPANY UNDER SECTION 2(17) OF THE INCOME-TAX ACT
As per section 2(17), company means:
(i) any Indian company, or
(ii) any body corporate incorporated by or under the laws of a country outside India, or
(iii) any institution, association or body which is or was assessable or was assessed as a company for any
assessment year under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 (11 of 1922) or was assessable or was assessed
under this Act, as a company for any assessment year commencing on or before April 1, 1970; or
(iv) any institution, association or body, whether incorporated or not and whether Indian or non-Indian,
which is declared by general or special order of the CBDT to be a company.
Provided that such institution, association or body shall be deemed to be a company only for such assessment
year or assessment years (whether commencing before the 1st day of April 1971, or on or after that date) as
may be specified in the declaration.

CBDT Order
In cases where the CBDT specifies any association or body to be a company, it is essential that the order of the
Board is taken to be valid only in respect of the assessment year or years specifically mentioned in the Board’s
order. The Board’s power is specifically made exercisable in respect of past assessment year. In other words,
the declaration of the Board does not automatically mean that the association or body would continue to be
treated as a company for all purposes and for all assessment years. Whilst declaring any institution, association
or body as a company, the Board has also to justify itself that they have characteristics as would generally
enable them to be recognized as companies in common parlance as sometimes, such a declaration may be
sought for by institutions for avoiding taxes.
The power of the Board to declare any foreign association or body as a company is absolute and unqualified
and the Board would normally declare such association or body to be a ‘company’ only after taking into
consideration the benefit to the revenue (Section 119 read together with Section 295 of the Income Tax Act,
1961).

Lesson 8

Computation of Tax Liability of Companies 441

Liquidating Company
A Company in liquidation is also a “company” and the Income tax authorities are entitled to call upon the liquidator
to make a return of the company’s income. Likewise, penalty proceedings can also be initiated against a company
in liquidation for a default committed prior to liquidation. Thus, the expression Company as defined in the Income
Tax Act has a much wider connotation than what is normally understood by a ‘Company’ under the Companies
Act.

Companies established under section 25 of the Companies Act,1956*
In order to be regarded as a taxable entity under the Income Tax Act, 1961, it is not essential that the company
must always have a share capital and must have been formed with a profit motive. Even companies having no
share capital and those, which are limited by guarantee, are assessable as companies for income-tax purposes
even if such companies may have been formed without any profit motive and registered under Section 25 of the
Companies Act 1956* (e.g. Chambers of Commerce etc.). Under Section 28 (iii) of the Income tax Act, 1961,
trade, professional or similar associations are liable to tax in respect of the income they derive from rendering of
specific services to their members. Accordingly, in respect of specific services to their members, such entities,
even if they are non-profit making, would become liable to tax under the Income tax Act as a company in respect
of their income from business although they may not have been specifically formed to carry on any business
with a view to make profit. A statutory corporation established under the Act of Parliament, Government companies
and the State Government companies who carry on a trade or business would also be treated as a company for
all purposes of income tax.

Discontinuance of Business
A company or for that matter, any assessee who discontinued their business are statutorily required to intimate
to the Assessing Officer within 15 days (Section 176 of the Income Tax Act, 1961).

Assessment of Companies
For assessment to income tax, each company is assessed separately although the companies might be interrelated or inter-connected; for instance, holding and subsidiary companies must be assessed separately to
Income tax in respect of the profits made by each of them since they have a separate and distinct legal existence.
The Supreme Court in the case of Mrs. Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT (1955) 27 ITR 1(SC) has held that dividend
received from a company earning agricultural income is not an agricultural income in the hands of the shareholders
and therefore does not qualify for exemption under Section 10 (1) which grants exemption to agricultural income.

CATEGORIES OF COMPANIES UNDER THE INCOME TAX ACT, 1961
In continuation of our, earlier discussion on definition of company, we will now discuss broadly the different
categories of companies:
Categories of
Companies

Indian Company
Company

Domestic
Company

Foreign
Company

Let us now discuss these in detail from taxation point of view.

Widely Held

Closely Held
Company

442 EP-TL&P

Indian Company
Section 2(26) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 defines the expression ‘Indian Company’ as a company formed and
registered under the Companies Act, 1956* and includes:
(a) a company formed and registered under any law relating to companies formerly in force in any part of
India (other than the State of Jammu and Kashmir, and the Union Territories specified in (e) below);
(b) any corporation established by or under a Central, State or Provincial Act;
(c) any institution, association or body which is declared by the Board to be a company under Section 2(17)
of the Income Tax Act, 1961;
(d) in the case of State of Jammu & Kashmir, any company formed and registered under any law for the
time being in force in that State; and
(e) in the case of any of the Union Territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Goa, Daman and Diu and
Pondicherry, a company formed and registered under any law for the time being in force in that Union
Territory;
Provided that the registered or, as the case may be, principal office of the company, corporation, institution,
association or body in all cases is in India.
From the above definition, it may be seen that statutory corporations as well as government companies are
automatically treated as Indian companies for purposes of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The definition of an Indian
company has been specifically given under the Income Tax Act, 1961 because of the fact that Indian companies
are entitled to certain special tax benefits under this Act. It must be noted that all companies falling within the
definition given in Section 2(17) of the Act are not necessarily Indian companies whereas all Indian companies
are companies within the meaning of Section 2(17) of the Act.
“Infrastructural capital company” as defined under Section 2(26A) means such company which makes investments
by way of acquiring shares or providing long-term finance to any enterprise or undertaking wholly engaged in
the business referred to in Sub-section (4) of Section 80-IA or Sub-section (1) of Section 80-IAB or an undertaking
developing and building a housing project referred to in Sub-section (10) of Section 80-IB or a project for
constructing a hotel of not less than three-star category as classified by the Central Government or a project for
constructing a hospital with at least one-hundred beds for patients.

Domestic Company
Section 2(22A) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, defines domestic company as an Indian company or any other
company which, in respect of its income liable to tax under the Income Tax Act, has made the prescribed
arrangements for the declaration and payment within India, of the dividends (including dividends on preference
shares) payable out of such income.
From this definition, it is clear that all Indian companies are domestic companies while all domestic companies
need not necessarily be Indian companies. In other words, a non-Indian company would be considered as a
domestic company if it makes the prescribed arrangements for the declaration and payment of dividends in
India on which tax is deductible under Section 194. These arrangements are as follows:
(i) the share register of the company concerned, for all its shareholders, shall be regularly maintained at its
principal place of business within India in respect of any assessment year from a date not later than the
first day of April of such year.
(ii) the general meeting for passing the accounts of the previous year relevant to the assessment year
declaring any dividends in respect thereof shall be held only at a place within India;
*Now theCompanies Act, 2013

Lesson 8

Computation of Tax Liability of Companies 443

(iii) the dividends declared, if any, shall be payable only within India to all shareholders.

Foreign Company
Section 2(23A) of the Income tax Act defines foreign company as a company, which, is not a domestic company.
However, all non-Indian companies are not necessarily foreign companies. If a non-Indian company has made
the prescribed arrangements for declaration and payments of dividends within India, such a non-Indian company
must be treated as a “domestic company” and not as a “foreign company”.

Test Your Knowledge
1. A foreign company may be treated as domestic company under the Income
Tax Act, 1961. True or False?

COMPANY IN WHICH PUBLIC ARE SUBSTANTIALLY INTERESTED (A WIDELY-HELD COMPANY)
Section 2(18) of the Income Tax, Act defines the expression “company in which the public are substantially interested”.
A company is said to be one in which public are substantially interested in the following cases, namely –
(i) If it is a company owned by the Government or the Reserve Bank of India or in which not less than 40
per cent of the shares, whether singly or taken together, are held by the Government or the Reserve
Bank of India or a corporation owned by the Reserve Bank of India; or
(ii) If it is a company which is registered under Section 25 of the Companies Act, 1956*; or
(iii) If it is a company, having no share capital and if, having regard to its objects, the nature and composition
of its membership and other relevant considerations, it is declared by an order of the Board (CBDT) to
be a company in which the public are substantially interested. However, such a company shall be
deemed to be one in which the public are substantially interested only for the assessment year(s) as
may be specified in the declaration; or
(iv) If it is mutual benefit finance a company which carries on, as its principal business, the business of
acceptance of deposits from its members and which is declared by the Central Government under
Section 620A of the Companies Act, 1956** to be a Nidhi or Mutual Benefit Society; or
(v) If it is a company in which shares carrying not less than 50 per cent of the voting power have been
allotted unconditionally to or acquired unconditionally by, and are throughout the relevant previous year
beneficially held by, one or more cooperative societies; or
(vi) If it is a company which is not a private company as defined in Companies Act, and equity shares of the
company (not being shares entitled to a fixed rate of dividend whether with or without a further right to
participate in the profits, i.e. preference shares) were, as on the last day of the relevant previous year,
listed in a recognised stock exchange in India;
(vii) If it is a company which is not a private company within the meaning of the Companies Act, and the
* Now Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013.
** Now Section 406 of the Companies Act, 2013.

444 EP-TL&P
shares in the company (not being shares entitled to a fixed rate of dividend whether with or without a
further right to participate in profits) carrying not less than 50 per cent (40 per cent in case of an industrial
company) of the voting power have been allotted unconditionally to, or acquired unconditionally by, and
were throughout the relevant accounting year beneficially held by (a) the Government, or (b) a corporation
established by a Central or State or Provincial Act, or (c) any company in which the public are substantially
interested or a wholly owned subsidiary company.
Industrial Company means an Indian company where business consists mainly in the construction of ships or in
the manufacture or processing of goods or in mining or in the generation or distribution of electricity or any other
form of power.
It may be noted that, a public company under the Companies Act, need not necessarily fall within the
meaning of a company in which the public are substantially interested under the Income-tax Act, 1961
because a public company under the Companies Act, may be considered as one in which the public are not
substantially interested under the Income-tax Act, 1961 after considering the nature and extent of
shareholding.

Closely held company
A Company in which the public is not substantially interested is known as a closely held company.
The distinction between a closely held and widely held company is significant from the following viewpoints.
(i) Section 2(22) (e), which deems certain payments as dividend, is applicable only to the shareholders of
a closely-held company; and
(ii) A closely held company is allowed to carry forward its business losses only if the conditions specified in
Section 79 are satisfied.

TAX INCIDENCE UNDER INCOME TAX ACT, 1961
As you know, the incidence of Income tax depends upon the residential status of a company in India during the
relevant previous year. A Company may be either resident or non-resident in India, i.e., company can not be
ordinary or not-ordinary resident.
According to Section 6(3) of the Act, a company is said to be resident in India (resident company) in any
previous year, if:
(i) It is an Indian company; or
(ii) the control and management of its affairs is situated wholly in India.
If any of the above two tests is satisfied the company would be a resident company in India during that previous
year.
Note: In order to provide clarity in respect of implementation of POEM based rule of residence and also to
address concerns of the stakeholders, Finance Act, 2016 defer the applicability of POEM based residence test
by one year and the determination of residence based on POEM shall be applicable from 01/04/17.
According to Section 5(1) of the Act, the total income of any previous year of a resident company would consist of:
(i) income received or deemed to be received in India during the previous year by or on behalf of such
company;
(ii) income which accrues or arises or is deemed to accrue or arise to it in India during the previous year;
(iii) income which accrues or arises to it outside India during the previous year.
It is important to note that under clause (iii) only income accruing or arising outside India is included. Income

Lesson 8

Computation of Tax Liability of Companies 445

deemed to accrue or arise outside India is not includible in the hands of residents. Hence, net dividends received
from foreign companies are includible in income and not the gross dividends [CIT v. Shaw Wallace & Co. Ltd.
(1981) 132 ITR 466].
In this context, the Calcutta High Court had followed the Supreme Court’s decision in Commissioner of Incometax v. Clive Insurance Co. Ltd. (1978, 113 ITR 636) holding that the assessee could be said to have paid Income
Tax in U.K, by deduction or otherwise, in respect of the net dividend so as to be eligible for relief contemplated
by Section 49D of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922. Following the Supreme Court’s decision, the Bombay High
Court held in the case of Commissioner of Income tax v. Tata Chemicals Ltd. (1986, 162 ITR 556) that the
assessee was entitled to double taxation relief under Section 91 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 in respect of
dividends from the United Kingdom. Following its decision in the case of Shaw Wallace & Co. Ltd. (supra), the
Calcutta High Court held in the case of the same assessee (1983, 143 ITR 207) that dividends from foreign
companies are to be assessed not on the gross amount of the dividends but on the gross amount of the dividends
less tax deducted there from in foreign countries. In other words, only the net foreign dividends are to be
included in the total income of a resident assessee under Section 5(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Under Section 5(2) of the Act, the total income of any previous year of non-resident company would consist of:
(i) Income received or deemed to be received in India in the previous year by or on behalf of such company;
(ii) Income which accrues or arises or is deemed to accrue or arise to it in India during the previous year.
The decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Standard Triumph Motor Co. Ltd. v. CIT (1993) 201 ITR 391 to the
effect that when an Indian resident passes an entry crediting a non-resident with amount payable to him, that
would tantamount to the latter receiving income in India, is having grave consequences. In this case, the royalty
payable to non-resident in pound sterling was credited to the non-residents accounts in the books of the assessee.
The Supreme Court held that the plea to accept royalty income in U.K. was immaterial because the amount was
available for the use of the non-resident in India in any manner he liked. Hence, the income was received in India.
In the wake of this decision, non-residents who have all along been held to be not liable to Indian Income-tax if the
contract was signed outside India, executed outside India and paid for outside India could well fall into the Indiantax net, should their clients/customers credit them for the amount due before making payments to them outside
India. In other words, a non-resident’s tax liability depends upon the accounting entry passed by his client customer.

Note: 1. On Domestic Company Surcharge is applicable @ 7% in case total income exceeds ` 1 Crore and @
12% in case total income exceeds ` 10 Crore.
2. In case of foreign companies : Surcharge @ 2% where total income exceeds ` 1 Crore and @ 5% where total
income exceeds ` 10 Crore shall be applicable.
3. Plus Education Cess @ 2% and Secondary & Higher Education Cess @ 1% on tax & surcharge
Marginal Relief: In case of the above assessees having a total income exceeding ` 1 crore, marginal relief
would be provided to ensure that the additional income-tax payable including surcharge, on the excess of

In other words, marginal relief = Tax on total income (plus surcharge) – [Tax on total income of ` 1 crore + (Total
Income – ` 1 crore)], if positive.

Section 115BA [New Section inserted vide Finance Act, 2016]
In order to provide relief to newly setup domestic companies engaged solely in the business of manufacture or
production of article or thing, a new section 115BA inserted to provide that the income-tax payable in respect of
the total income of a domestic company for any previous year relevant to the assessment year beginning on or
after the 1st day of April, 2017 shall be computed @ 25% at the option of the company, if, i. the company has been setup and registered on or after 1st day of March, 2016 and is engaged in the
business of manufacture or production of any article or thing and is not engaged in any other business;
ii. the company while computing its total income has not claimed any benefit under section 10AA, benefit
of accelerated depreciation, benefit of additional depreciation, investment allowance, expenditure on
scientific research and any deduction in respect of certain income under Part-C of Chapter-VI-A other
than the provisions of section 80JJAA; and
iii. the option is furnished in the prescribed manner before the due date of furnishing of income.

MINIMUM ALTERNATE TAX (MAT)
Section 115J which was a special provision applicable to a company if its total income as computed under the
Income tax Act was less than thirty per cent of its book profit was introduced with effect from 1.4.1988 but was
discontinued with effect from 1.4.1991. It was revived as Section 115JA with effect from 1.4.1997 as a provision
deeming total income equal to thirty per cent of book profit of companies referred to earlier. This provision was
also discontinued with effect from 1.4.2001 but was substituted by Section 115JB effective from the same date.
This provision follows concept of minimum alternate Tax.
As provided out in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Finance Bill, 2000, the Minimum Alternate Tax had been

Lesson 8

Computation of Tax Liability of Companies 447

levied from the assessment year 1997-98 as the number of zero tax companies and companies paying marginal
tax had proliferated. The efficacy of that provision, however, had declined in view of the exclusions of various
sectors from the operation of MAT and the tax credit systems.
Hence, in its place the new provisions of Section 115JB were inserted which are simpler in application. They
provide that all companies having book profits under the Companies Act shall have to pay a minimum alternate
tax at a rate of 18.5%. These provisions are applicable to all corporate entities.
According to this section, if the income tax payable by a company on its total income as computed under the Income
Tax Act in respect of any previous year relevant to the assessment year commencing on or after the 1st day of April,
2012, is less than 18.5% of such book profit plus surcharge plus education cess then such book profit shall be
treated as total income of the company and the tax payable for the relevant previous year shall be deemed to be
18.5% of such book profit. This non-absolute provision will override any other provision of the Income Tax Act.
Thus, where the Income-tax payable is less than 18.5% of Book Profit, such book profit will be deemed to be
total Income and Income Tax will be payable @ 18.5% on such Book Profit.
Such company assessee has to prepare Profit & Loss A/c in accordance with the provisions of Part II of Schedule
VI of the Companies Act, 1956.*
Sub-section (2) of this section requires the company in this case will prepare its profit and loss account for the
relevant previous year in accordance with the provisions of Parts II of Schedule VI of the Companies Act, 1956*.
However, while preparing the annual accounts including profit and loss account –
(a) the accounting policies;
(b) the accounting standards followed for preparing such accounts including profit and loss accounts; and
(c) the method and rates adopted for calculating the depreciation,
shall be the same as have been adopted for the purpose of preparing such accounts including profit and loss
account and laid before the company at its annual general meeting in accordance with the provisions of Section
210 of the Companies Act, 1956**. But where the company has adopted or adopts the financial year, which is
different from the previous year under the Income Tax Act, (a), (b) and (c) aforesaid shall correspond to the
accounting policies, accounting standards and the method and rates for calculating the depreciation which have
been adopted for preparing such accounts including profit and loss account for such financial year or part of
such financial year falling within the relevant previous year.
As per section 115JB, every company is required to prepare its accounts as per Schedule VI of the Companies
Act, 1956. However, as per the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956, certain companies, e.g. Insurance,
Banking or Electricity Company, are allowed to prepare their profit and loss account in accordance with the
provisions specified in their regulatory Acts.
In order to align the provisions of Income-tax Act with the Companies Act, 1956, with effect from assessment
year 2013-14, section 115JB has been amended to provide that the companies which are not required under
section 211 of the Companies Act** to prepare their profit and loss account in accordance with the Schedule VI
of the Companies Act, 1956*, profit and loss account prepared in accordance with the provisions of their regulatory
Acts shall be taken as a basis for computing the book profit under section 115JB.
However, a sub-section (5A) has been inserted to section 5, w.e.f A.Y. 2001-02, which provides that the MAT
provisions shall not apply to any income accruing or arising to a company from life insurance business.

(b) “unit” means a unit established in an International Financial Services Centre;
(c) “convertible foreign exchange” means a foreign exchange which is for the time being treated by the
Reserve Bank of India as convertible foreign exchange for the purposes of the Foreign Exchange

1. Whether the provisions of MAT applicable to foreign companies or not?
Since ‘company’ defined u/s 2(17) includes any body corporate incorporated under the laws outside India,
so foreign companies are also liable to MAT in respect of their income in India.
However, foreign companies shall not liable u/s 115JB without physical presence.
The Authority for Advance Ruling (“AAR”) has delivered a ruling in the case of Timken India Ltd. In re (2005)
273 ITR 67 (AAR) where it holds that the provisions of section 115JB of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“the Act”)
levying Minimum Alternate Tax (“MAT”) on the book profit of a Company would not apply to a Foreign
Company not having any physical presence in India. In this case, the AAR distinguished its earlier ruling of
1998 (234 ITR 828) wherein it had held that a foreign company would be subject to MAT provisions. The
critical factor for distinguishing was on the basis that in the earlier ruling the applicant had a project office in
India, which constituted a Permanent Establishment and was preparing its financial statements as required
under Indian Companies Act, 1956. In order to comply with the requirement of MAT provisions regarding
preparing Profit & Loss Account in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Companies Act, it is essential
that the foreign company should have a place of business within India.
Similar view has been upheld by AAR in the recent ruling of Praxair Pacific Ltd., In re [2010] 326 ITR 276 (AAR)
Further, the provisions of section 115JB were amended vide Finance Act, 2015 to provide that in case of a
foreign company any income chargeable at a rate lower than the rate specified in section 115JB shall be
reduced from the book profits and the corresponding expenditure will be added back.
However, since this amendment was prospective w.e.f. assessment year 2016-17, the issue for assessment
year prior to 2016-17 remained to be addressed.
With a view to provide certainty in taxation of foreign companies, an amedment has been made vide Finance
Act, 2016 so as to provide that with effect from 01.04.2001, the provisions of section 115JB shall not be
applicable to a foreign company if –
– the assessee is a resident of a country or a specified territory with which India has an agreement
referred to in sub-section (1) of section 90 or the Central Government has adopted any agreement
under sub-section (1) of section 90A and the assesse does not have a permanent establishment in
India in accordance with the provisions of such Agreement; or
– the assessee is a resident of a country with which India does not have an agreement of the nature
referred to in clause (i) above and the assessee is not required to seek registration under any law for the
time being in force relating to companies.
This amendment effective retrospectively from the 1st day of April, 2001 and accordingly apply in
relation to assessment year 2001-02 and subsequent years.
2. Whether Assessing Officer (AO) has the power to examine correctness of net profits shown in
P&L Account [Apollo Tyres Ltd. v. CIT (2002) 255 ITR 273 (SC)]
The AO does not have the power to question correctness of P&L A/c prepared by assessee and certified by
the statutory auditors of the company as having been prepared in accordance with the provisions of Parts II

452 EP-TL&P
and III of Schedule VI to the Companies Act, 1956. The AO does not have the jurisdiction to go behind the
net profits shown in the P&L A/c except to the extent provided in the Explanation 1 to Section 115JB.
3. Interest u/s 234B is payable on failure to pay advance tax in respect of tax payable u/s 115JB. [CIT v.
Rolta India Ltd. (2011) 330 ITR 470 (SC) and Circular No. 13/2001]

MAT Credit under section 115JAA
MAT Credit for taxes paid as per Section 115JB in earlier years (in which MAT liability was more than tax liability
as per normal provisions of the Act) is available in the Assessment year in which Tax payable on the total income
computed under the normal provisions of this Act is more than tax payable u/s 115JB for that Assessment year.

Lesson 8

Computation of Tax Liability of Companies 453

The Finance Act 2014 has inserted sub-section (1B) in section 115-O to ensure that tax is levied on a proper
base. In order to ensure that tax is levied on a proper base, the dividend actually received need to be grossed up
for the purpose of computing the dividend distribution tax.
For the purpose of determining the tax on distributed profits payable in accordance with this section, any amount
by way of dividends referred to in sub-section (1) as reduced by the amount referred to in sub-section (1A) shall
be called net distributed profits. This net distributed profit shall be increased to such amounts as would, after
reduction of the tax on such increased amount at the rate of 15% plus surcharge and education cess & SHEC,
be equal to the net distributed profits.
Thus, where the amount of dividend paid or distributed by a company is Rs. 85 lakhs, then Dividend Distribution
Tax (DDT) under the amended provision would be calculated as follows:
Dividend amount distributed = ` 85 lakhs
Increase by ` 17,78,611 [i.e. (85*0.17304)/(1-0.17304)]
Increased amount = ` 1,02,78,611
DDT @ 15% plus surcharge @ 12% and education cess and SHEC @ 3% of ` 1,02,78,611 = ` 17,78,611
Tax payable u/s 115-O is ` 17,78,611
Dividend distributed to shareholders = ` 85 lakhs
Similarly, section 115R is amended by the Finance Act 2014 to provide that for the purposes of determining the
additional income-tax payable in accordance with section 115R (2), the amount of distributed income shall be
increased to such amount as would, after reduction of the additional income-tax on such increased amount at
the rate specified in section 115R (2), be equal to the amount of income distributed by the Mutual Fund.
Further, No tax on distributed profits shall be chargeable under this section in respect of any amount declared,
distributed or paid by the specified domestic company by way of dividends (whether interim or otherwise) to a
business trust out of its current income on or after the specified date.
Provided further, that nothing contained in this sub-section shall apply in respect of any amount declared,
distributed or paid, at any time, by the specified domestic company by way of dividends (whether interim or
otherwise) out of its accumulated profits and current profits up to the specified date.
Explanation. – For the purposes of this sub-section, –
(a) “specified domestic company” means a domestic company in which a business trust has become the
holder of whole of the nominal value of equity share capital of the company (excluding the equity share
capital required to be held mandatorily by any other person in accordance with any law for the time
being in force or any directions of Government or any regulatory authority, or equity share capital held
by any Government or Government body);
(b) “specified date” means the date of acquisition by the business trust of such holding as is referred to in
clause (a).]
Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, no tax on distributed profits shall be chargeable in respect of
the total income of a company, being a unit of an International Financial Services Centre, deriving income solely
in convertible foreign exchange, for any assessment year on any amount declared, distributed or paid by such
company, by way of dividends (whether interim or otherwise) on or after the 1st day of April, 2017, out of its
current income, either in the hands of the company or the person receiving such dividend.
Explanation. – For the purposes of this sub-section, –

Where the total income of an Indian company, includes any income by way of dividends declared, distributed or
paid by a specified foreign company such income shall be chargeable to tax @15% and such income shall be
reduced from the total income.

RATIONALIZATION OF TAXATION OF INCOME BY WAY OF DIVIDEND [SECTION 115BBDA]
Under the existing provisions of clause (34) of section 10 of the Act, dividend which suffer dividend distribution tax
(DDT) under section 115-O is exempt in the hands of the shareholder. Under section 115-O dividends are taxed
only at the rate of fifteen percent at the time of distribution in the hands of company declaring dividends. This
creates vertical inequity amongst the tax payers as those who have high dividend income are subjected to tax only
at the rate of 15% whereas such income in their hands would have been chargeable to tax at the rate of 30%.
With a view to rationalise the tax treatment provided to income by way of dividend, it is provided by amending the
section of the Income-tax Act that any income by way of dividend in aggregate exceeding Rs. 10 lakh shall be
chargeable to tax in the case of an individual, Hindu undivided family (HUF) or a firm who is resident in India, at
the rate of 10%. The taxation of dividend income in aggregate exceeding ten lakh rupees shall be on gross
basis. (w.e.f. 1st April, 2016).

INTRODUCTION
In the early stages of development every country has to depend to some extent on foreign capital and foreign
technicians for the industrial development of the country. The Government of India also has been extremely
anxious to attract foreign capital and technical know-how. To attract these, certain tax concessions have been
granted to foreign investors and technicians and the Government has plans to offer still more concessions in the
near future. The foreign investors may be Indian Nationals who reside outside India and other foreign investors
including corporations. A person who resides outside India is technically known as “non-resident”. The residential
status of an individual does not depend upon the nationality or domicile of that person but it depends upon his
stay in India during the previous year. In case of an assessee, other than an individual, the residence depends
upon the place from which its affairs are controlled and managed.
The provisions of section 6 of the Income-tax Act (Act) provides for the conditions under which a person can be
said to be resident in India for a previous year. In respect of a person being a company the conditions are
contained in clause (3) of section 6 of the Act. Under the said clause, a company is said to be resident in India
in any previous year, if –
(i) it is an Indian company; or
(ii) during that year, the control and management of its affairs is situated wholly in India.

computing the investment income of a non-resident Indian -

466 EP-TL&P
In case of an assessee being a non-resident Indian (a) if the gross total income consists only of investment income or income by way of long-term capital gains
or both, no deductions shall be allowed to the assessee under chapter VI-A (Sections 80C to 80U) and
nothing contained in the provisions of the second proviso to Section 48 shall apply to income chargeable

(b) if the gross total income of such an assessee includes any income referred to under clause (a) above,
the gross total income shall be reduced by the amount of such income and the deductions under chapter
VI-A shall be allowed as if the gross total income as so reduced were the gross total income of the
assessee.

TAX ON INVESTMENT INCOME AND LONG-TERM CAPITAL GAINS (115E)

CAPITAL GAINS ON TRANSFER OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE ASSETS NOT TO BE CHARGED IN
CERTAIN CASES (115F)
In a case where a foreign exchange asset is transferred by the assessee and the net consideration for the
transfer is invested by him within six months of the date of transfer in any specified asset or in notified savings
certificates, any long-term capital gains arising from the transfer will not be charged to tax. If investment in the
aforesaid specified assets or savings certificates is less than the net consideration, the exemption from tax in
respect of the long-term capital gain will be allowed on proportionate basis.
It is also provided that if the new asset acquired by investing the net consideration realised on transfer of the
foreign exchange asset is transferred or converted (otherwise than by transfer) into money, within three years
from the date of acquisition, the amount of capital gains earlier exempted will be regarded as capital gains
relating to long-term capital asset of the year in which the new asset is transferred or converted (otherwise than

ASSESSEE BECOMES RESIDENT (115H)

respect of the total income of any subsequent year, he may furnish to the Assessing Officer a declaration in
writing along with his return of income under section 139 for the assessment year for which he is so assessable,
to the effect that the provisions of this Chapter shall continue to apply to him in relation to the investment income

Lesson 9

Computation of Tax Liability of Non-resident Assessees

467

derived from any foreign exchange asset and if he does so, the provisions of Chapter XII-A shall continue to
apply to him in relation to such income for that assessment year and for every subsequent assessment year
until the transfer or conversion (otherwise than by transfer) into money of such assets.
In other words, in the case of a non-resident Indian who becomes resident in India in a subsequent year, the
provisions of this Chapter XII-A will continue to apply in relation to the investment income derived from
debentures of and deposits with an Indian public limited company and Central Government securities acquired
in convertible foreign exchange, and other notified assets until the transfer or conversion (otherwise than by
transfer) into money of such asset.

CHAPTER NOT TO APPLY IF THE ASSESSEE SO CHOOSES (115-I)
According to this section, a non-resident Indian will have the option or choice of not being assessed under the
above provisions, for any assessment year by furnishing his return of income for that assessment year under
Section 139, declaring therein his intention to that effect.

MODIFICATION IN THE PROVISIONS OF COMPUTATION OF CAPITAL GAINS FROM SHARES/
DEBENTURES
The first proviso to Section 48 was amended by the Finance Act, 1992 with effect from the assessment year
1993-94.
With the amendment all non-residents (instead of NRIs) are entitled to the protection from fluctuation of rupee
value against foreign currency in respect of capital gains on shares in or debentures of Indian Companies. Thus,
for all non-residents, capital gains arising from the transfer of capital asset being shares in or debentures of an
Indian company shall be computed by converting the cost of acquisition, expenditure incurred wholly and
exclusively in connection with such transfer and the full value of the consideration received or accruing as a
result of the transfer of the capital asset into the same foreign currency as was initially utilised in the purchase of
the shares or debentures and the capital gains so computed in such foreign currency shall be reconverted into
Indian currency, so however, that the aforesaid manner of computation of capital gains shall be applicable in
respect of capital gains accruing or arising from every reinvestment thereafter, in, and sale of shares in, or
debentures of an Indian company.

TAX ON DIVIDENDS, ROYALTY AND TECHNICAL SERVICE FEES (SECTION 115A)

policy shall be taxable @ 10%.
Earlier, this rate was 25% as provided by Finance Act, 2013. However, in order to reduce the hardship
faced by small entities due to high rate of tax of 25%, amendment has been made vide Finance Act,
2015 to reduce the rate of tax provided under section 115A on royalty and FTS payments made to nonresidents to 10%.

year consisted only of income referred to in points (i) to (v) above; and

[mentioned in (a)], it shall not be entitled to claim deductions under Sections 80C to 80U against such capital gains.
The assessee shall not be eligible to calculate capital gains by converting selling price (in Indian currency) into
foreign currency which it had brought to invest in securities.
Further, for computation of long-term capital gains, it shall not be entitled to opt indexed cost of acquisition in lieu
of cost of acquisition.:
Foreign Institutional Investor shall pay income tax on such income at the following rates:
On short-term capital gains covered by section 111A

15%

On short-term capital gains on transfer of securities

30%

On long-term capital gains on transfer of securities

10%

The amount of Income tax calculated on the income by way of interest referred to in section 194LD shall be
taxable at the rate of 5%.
Vide Finance Act (No.2), 2014, it was provided that any securities held by a Foreign Institutional Investor which
has invested in such securities in accordance with the regulations made under the Securities and Exchange
Board of India Act, 1992 would be capital asset. Consequently, the income arising to a Foreign Institutional
Investor from transactions in securities would always be in the nature of capital gains.
An amendment to the provisions of section 115JB has been made vide Finance Act, 2015 so as to provide that
income from transactions in securities (other than short term capital gains arising on transactions on which
securities transaction tax is not chargeable) arising to a Foreign Institutional Investor, shall be excluded from the
chargeability of MAT and the profit corresponding to such income shall be reduced from the book profit. The
expenditures, if any, debited to the profit and loss account, corresponding to such income (which is to be excluded
from the MAT liability) are also added back to the book profit for the purpose of computation of MAT.
In view of the above, A new clause (iic)has been inserted in Explanation 1 so as to provide that the amount of
income from transactions in securities, (other than short term capital gains arising on transactions on which
securities transaction tax is not chargeable), accruing or arising to an assessee being a Foreign Institutional
Investor which has invested in such securities in accordance with the regulations made under the Securities and
Exchange Board of India Act,1992,if any such amount is credited to the profit and loss account, shall be reduced
from the book profit for the purposes of calculation of income-tax payable under the section. Further by inserting
a new clause (fb) in Explanation 1, it has been provided that the book profit shall be increased by the amount or
amounts of expenditure relatable to the above income.
These amendments are effective from 1st April, 2016 and accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year
2016-17 and subsequent assessment years.

TAX ON INCOME FROM BONDS OR GLOBAL DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS PURCHASED IN
FOREIGN CURRENCY OR CAPITAL GAINS ARISING FROM THEIR TRANSFER (SECTION 115AC)
The Finance Act, 2001, has substituted new Section 115AC for the existing section, to have effect from
1.4.2002, i.e. for assessment year 2002-03 and subsequent assessment years. This section extends the
concessional rate of tax to Global Depository Receipts issued under other notified schemes of the Central
Government also.
(a) Global Depository Receipts issued in accordance with a scheme notified by the Central Government in
the official gazette against the initial issue of underlying shares of Indian company and purchased by
the non-resident in foreign currency through an approved intermediary; or
(b) Global Depository Receipts issued against shares of a public sector company sold by the Government
and purchased by the non-resident in foreign currency through an approved intermediary; or
(c) Global Depository Receipts re-issued against the existing underlying shares of an Indian company in
accordance with such scheme as the Central Government may notify in the official gazette, and purchased
by the non-resident in foreign currency through an approved intermediary;
Where however, the gross total income of the non-resident includes interest income or dividend other than
dividends referred to in Section 115-O income from such bonds/GDRs as mentioned above, as well as other
income, the gross total income in such case shall be reduced by the amount of such income (i.e. interest/
dividend income) and the deduction under Chapter VI-A (i.e. Sections 80C to 80U) shall be applicable on the
gross total income as so reduced.
Income
(a) where the total income consist only interest
income/dividend income from such bonds/
shares or long term capital gains arising
from transfer of such bonds/shares

Tax payable
10% of such income

First and second provisions to section 48
shall not apply for computation of long term
capital gains arising out of the transfer of
such Global Depository Receipts being long
term capital assets.
(b) where total income includes income as
mentioned in (a) above plus other income

10% of income from (a) plus tax payable at normal
rate on the balance income i.e. total income minus
income of the type as mentioned in (a).

Amendments relating to Global Depository receipts (GDRs)
The Depository Receipts Scheme, 2014 has been notified by the Department of Economic affairs (DEA) vide
Notification F.No.9/1/2013–ECB dated 21st October, 2014. This scheme replaces “Issue of Foreign Currency
Convertible Bonds and Ordinary Shares (through depository receipt mechanism) Scheme, 1993”.
The current taxation scheme of income arising in respect of depository receipts under the Act is aligned with the
earlier scheme which was limited to issue of Depository Receipts (DRs) based on the underlying shares of the
company issued for this purpose i.e sponsored GDR or FCCB of the issuing company and where the company
was either a listed company or was to list simultaneously. Besides, the holder of such DRs was a non-resident
only.
As per the new scheme, DRs can be issued against the securities of listed, unlisted or private or public companies

Lesson 9

Computation of Tax Liability of Non-resident Assessees

471

against underlying securities which can be debt instruments, shares or units etc; Further, both the sponsored
issues and unsponsored deposits and acquisitions are permitted. DRs can be freely held and transferred by
both residents and non-residents.
Since the tax benefits under the Act were intended to be provided in respect of sponsored GDRs and listed
companies only, an amendment is made in the Act in order to continue the tax benefits only in respect of such
GDRs as defined in the earlier depository scheme.
These amendments are effective from the 1st day of April, 2016 and accordingly, apply to the assessment year
2016-17 and subsequent assessment years.

PROFITS OF NON-RESIDENTS FROM OCCASIONAL SHIPPING BUSINESS (SECTION 172)
The provisions of Section 172 apply for the purpose of levy and recovery of tax in the case of any ship
belonging to or chartered by a non-resident, which carries passengers, live-stock, mail or goods shipped at a
port in India.
A sum equal to 7-1/2% of the aggregate of the amounts specified below shall be deemed to be the profits and
gains of such business chargeable to tax under the head “Profits and gains of business or profession”:
(i) The amount paid or payable (whether in or out of India) to the assessee or to any person on his
behalf on account of the carriage of passengers, live-stock, mail or goods shipped at any port in India; and
(ii) The amount received or deemed to be received in India by or on behalf of the assessee on account of
the carriage of passengers, live-stock, mail or goods shipped at any port outside India.
However, if the assessee feels that it is in his interest to pay the tax on the basis of his total income, he may claim
before the expiry of the assessment year relevant to the previous year in which the date of departure of the ship
from Indian port falls, that an assessment be made of his total income of the previous year and the tax payable
on the basis thereof be determined in accordance with the other provisions of this Act. If he so claims, any
payment made during that previous year shall be treated as a payment of advance tax and the difference
between the sum so paid and the amount of tax found payable by him on such assessment shall be paid by him
or refunded to him as the case may be.
Before the departure from any port in India of a tram or ship, the master of the ship shall prepare and furnish to
the Assessing Officer a return of the full amount paid or payable on account of the carriage of all passengers,
live-stock, mail or goods shipped at that port since the last arrival of the ship thereat. If the Assessing Officer is
satisfied that it is not possible to furnish the return required before the departure of the ship from the port and the
master of the ship has made satisfactory arrangements for the filing of the return and payment of the tax by any
other person on his behalf, the Assessing Officer may, if the return is filed within 30 days of the departure of the
ship, deem the filing of the return by the person so authorised by the master.
On receipt of the return, the Assessing Officer shall assess the income and determine the sum payable as tax
thereon at the rate in force applicable to the total income of a company which has not made the prescribed
arrangements for declaration and payment of dividends within India.
A port clearance shall not be granted to a ship until the Port Authority is satisfied that tax assessable has been
duly paid or that satisfactory arrangements have been made for the payment thereof.
In the case of Union of India v. Gosalia Shipping (P) Ltd., The Supreme Court has held that where a non-resident
company hires a ship from another non-resident and loads the ship with own goods in India, neither the owner
of the ship nor the lessee receives any amount on account of the carriage of the goods. No tax is, therefore,
leviable under Section 172(2) [113 ITR 307 (S.C.)].

SPECIAL PROVISION FOR COMPUTING PROFITS AND GAINS OF THE BUSINESS OF
OPERATION OF AIRCRAFT IN THE CASE OF NON-RESIDENTS (SECTION 44BBA)
(1) In the case of an assessee, being a non-resident engaged in the business of operation of aircraft, a sum
equal to 5 per cent of the aggregate of the amounts specified in Sub-section (2) below shall be deemed to be the
profits and gains of such business chargeable to tax under the head ‘Profits and gains of business or profession’.
(2) The amount referred to above shall be the following:
(a) The amount paid or payable (whether in or out of India) to the assessee or to any person on his behalf
on account of the carriage of passengers, live-stock, mail or goods from any place in India, and
(b) the amount received or deemed to be received in India by or on behalf of the assessee on account of
the carriage of passengers, livestock, mail or goods from any place outside India.
With a view to simplifying the provisions relating to computation of taxable income of a non-resident, Section
44BBA provides that the income from such business shall be computed at a flat rate of 5% of the amount
received or receivable by or on behalf of the taxpayer for carriage of passengers, live-stock, mail or goods from
any place in India and the amount received or deemed to be received in India on account of such carriage from
any place outside India.

TAX ON INCOME FROM GLOBAL DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS PURCHASED IN FOREIGN
CURRENCY OR CAPITAL GAINS ARISING FROM THEIR TRANSFER (SECTION 115ACA)
In this section –
“Global Depository Receipts” means any instrument in the form of a depository receipt or certificate (by
whatever name called) created by the Overseas Depository Bank outside India and issued to non-resident
investors against the issue of ordinary shares or foreign currency convertible bonds of issuing company.
“Information Technology Service” means any service which results from the use of any information technology
software over a system of information technology products for realising value addition.
“Overseas Depository Bank” means a bank authorised by the issuing company to issue global depository
receipts against issue of foreign currency convertible bonds or ordinary shares of the issuing company.
This section applies to a resident individual employed in an Indian company which is engaged in information
technology software and information technology service.
If the total income of such assessee includes (a) dividend income (other than dividends referred to in Section 115-O) on global depository receipts of an
Indian company engaged in information technology services, issued in accordance with a notified
employees’ stock option scheme and purchased in foreign currency; or
(b) income by way of long term capital gains arising from the transfer of global depository receipts referred
above. Income tax shall be the aggregate of:
(i) tax @ 10% on dividend income referred to in point (a) above;
(ii) tax @ 10% on long term capital gains referred to in point (b) above;
(iii) the amount of income tax with which the resident employee would have been chargeable had his
total income been reduced by the amounts referred to in point (a) and (b) above
It is further provided that if the gross total income of the resident employee consists of dividend income referred
to in point (a) above, no deductions under any other provisions of this Act shall be allowed to him.
Further, if gross total income includes any income referred to in point (a) and (b) above, the gross total income
shall be reduced by such incomes and deductions under the provisions of this Act shall be allowed on such

Lesson 9

Computation of Tax Liability of Non-resident Assessees

473

reduced gross total income of the assessee. Also First and Second provisos to Section 48 shall not apply for
computation of long term capital gains arising out of the transfer of such Global Depository Receipts being long
term capital assets.
Examples:
Compute the income tax in the following cases:
(a) Royalty of ` 10 lakh received by a foreign company from an Indian concern in pursuance of an agreement
approved by the Central Government in the previous year 2015-16.
As per Section 115A, the rate of tax shall be 10%. Hence tax = `10 lakh x 10% = ` 1,00,000. No
surcharge as total income does not exceed ` 1 crore.
(b) ` 10 lakh long-term capital gains received by an overseas financial organisation on transfer of units
purchased in foreign currency.
Tax rate is 10% under section 115AB. Hence, tax = `10 lakh x 10.3% = ` 1,03,000.

RETURN OF INCOME
It shall not be necessary for a non-resident to furnish under Section 139(1) a return of his income of:
(a) his total income in respect of which he is assessable under this Act during the previous year consisted
only of interest income/dividend income as mentioned above; and

DETERMINATION OF INCOME IN CERTAIN CASES (RULE 10)
In any case in which the Assessing Officer (hereafter referred to as A.O.) is of opinion that actual amount of
income accruing or arising to any non-resident person through or from any business connection or through or
from any property in India or any asset or source of income in India or money lent at interest and brought into
India in cash or kind cannot be definitely ascertained, the amount of such income for the purpose of assessment
to income-tax may be calculated as under:
(i) at such percentage of the turnover so accruing or arising as the A.O. may consider to be reasonable; or
(ii) on any amount which bears the same proportion to the total profits and gains of the business of such
person (profits and gains being computed in accordance with the provisions of the Act), as the receipts
so accruing or arising bear to the total receipts of the business; or
(iii) in such other manner as the A.O. may deem suitable.
(iv) the tax deductible at source under the provisions of Chapter XVII-B of the Act has been deducted from
such income.

TRANSACTION NOT REGARDED AS TRANSFER
A new clause (viia) has been inserted in Section 47 by the Finance Act, 1992 with effect from 1.6.1992, to
provide that the transfer of bonds or shares referred to in Section 115AC(1) shall not be regarded as transfer for
the purposes of computation of capital gains tax if such transfer is made outside India by one non-resident to
another non-resident.

CERTAIN INCOMES OF NON-RESIDENTS TAXABLE IN INDIA
1. Profits of business: Such business profits of a non-resident as can reasonably be attributed to the
operations of the business carried out in India are taxable. Note that where the non-resident is making
purchase for exports, he is not required to pay tax on any profits he may earn by exports.
2. Income from property in India: The word property is of wide import for this purpose. It may include

474 EP-TL&P
both movable and immovable property but it must be something tangible. If furniture or machinery is
situated in India and is hired under an agreement by which the hire charges are payable outside India,
such income shall be taxed in India.
3. Income from any assets or source in India: The words asset or source are of wide import and may
include intangible property also like a debt or other chose-in-action. Any income from such sources
would be taxable.
4. Income from money brought into India and lent on interest: If a non-resident assessee brings some
money into India for lending purposes, any interest earned thereon will be deemed to accrue and arise
in India and will, therefore, be taxed in India.
5. Fees for Technical Services and Royalties: Fees received by a foreign enterprise for technical services
rendered to an Indian enterprise are taxable in India if either the services are rendered in India or the
fees are received in India.
Royalties arise wholly in the country in which the patent, trade-mark process etc., is actually exploited.
Thus, royalty received by a foreign patentee for the use of the patent in India shall be construed to arise
in India, though the patent may be registered in a foreign country.
Where a foreign company receives royalties from an Indian concern in pursuance of an agreement
made by it with the Indian concern after 31.3.61 or, receives fees for rendering technical services from
an Indian concern in pursuance of an agreement made by it with the Indian concern after 29.2.1964
and, where such agreement has, in either case, been approved by the Central Government, such
income shall be taxed at a rate of fifty per cent.

Clarity relating to indirect transfer provisions
Section 9 of the Act deal with income which are deemed to accrue or arise in India. Sub-section(1) of the said
section creates a legal fiction that certain incomes shall be deemed to accrue or arise in India. Further, clause (i)
of said sub-section (1) provides a set of circumstances in which income accruing or arising, directly or indirectly,
is taxable in India. The said clause provides that all income accruing or arising, whether directly or indirectly,
through or from any business connection in India, or through or from any property in India, or through or from
any asset or source of income in India, or through the transfer of a capital asset situate in India shall be deemed
to accrue or arise in India.
The Finance Act, 2012 inserted certain clarificatory amendments in the provisions of section 9. The amendments,
inter alia, included insertion of Explanation 5 in section 9(1)(i) w.r.e.f. 1.04.1962 . The Explanation 5 clarified that
an asset or capital asset, being any share or interest in a company or entity registered or incorporated outside
India shall be deemed to be situated in India if the share or interest derives, directly or indirectly, its value
substantially from the assets located in India.
Considering the concerns raised by various stakeholders regarding the scope and impact of these amendments
an Expert Committee under the Chairmanship of Dr. Parthasarathi Shome was constituted by the Government
to go into the various aspects relating to the amendments. The recommendations of the Expert Committee were
considered and a number of recommendations (either in full or with partial modifications) have been accepted
for implementation either by way of an amendment of the Act or by way of issuance of a clarificatory circular in
due course.
In order to give effect to the recommendations, Section 9 of the Act has been amended vide Fide Finance Act,
2015 in the following manner:(i) the share or interest of a foreign company or entity shall be deemed to derive its value substantially from
the assets (whether tangible or intangible) located in India, if on the specified date, the value of Indian
assets,-

Lesson 9

Computation of Tax Liability of Non-resident Assessees

475

(a) exceeds the amount of ten crore rupees ; and
(b) represents at least fifty per cent. of the value of all the assets owned by the company or entity.
(ii) value of an asset shall mean the fair market value of such asset without reduction of liabilities, if any, in
respect of the asset.
(iii) the specified date of valuation shall be the date on which the accounting period of the company or entity,
as the case may be, ends preceding the date of transfer.
(iv) however, if the book value of the assets of the company on the date of transfer exceeds by at least 15%
of the book value of the assets as on the last balance sheet date preceding the date of transfer, then
instead of the date mentioned in (iii) above, the date of transfer shall be the specified date of valuation.
(v) the manner of determination of fair market value of the Indian assets vis-a vis global assets of the
foreign company shall be prescribed in the rules.
(vi) the taxation of gains arising on transfer of a share or interest deriving, directly or indirectly, its value
substantially from assets located in India will be on proportional basis. The method for determination of
proportionality are proposed to be provided in the rules.
(vii) the exemption shall be available to the transferor of a share of, or interest in, a foreign entity if he along
with its associated enterprises,
(a) neither holds the right of control or management,
(b) nor holds voting power or share capital or interest exceeding five per cent. of the total voting power
or total share capital, in the foreign company or entity directly holding the Indian assets (direct
holding company).
(viii) in case the transfer is of shares or interest in a foreign entity which does not hold the Indian assets
directly then the exemption shall be available to the transferor if he along with its associated enterprises,(a) neither holds the right of management or control in relation to such company or the entity,
(b) nor holds any rights in such company which would entitle it to either exercise control or management
of the direct holding company or entity or entitle it to voting power exceeding five percent. in the
direct holding company or entity.
(ix) exemption shall be available in respect of any transfer, subject to certain conditions ,in a scheme of
amalgamation, of a capital asset, being a share of a foreign company which derives, directly or indirectly,
its value substantially from the share or shares of an Indian company, held by the amalgamating foreign
company to the amalgamated foreign company.
(x) exemption shall be available in respect of any transfer, subject to certain conditions, in a demerger, of a
capital asset, being a share of a foreign company which derives, directly or indirectly, its value substantially
from the share or shares of an Indian company, held by the demerged foreign company to the resulting
foreign company.
(xi) there shall be a reporting obligation on Indian concern through or in which the Indian assets are held by
the foreign company or the entity. The Indian entity shall be obligated to furnish information relating to
the off-shore transaction having the effect of directly or indirectly modifying the ownership structure or
control of the Indian company or entity. In case of any failure on the part of Indian concern in this regard
a penalty shall be leviable. The proposed penalty shall be(a) a sum equal to two percent of the value of the transaction in respect of which such failure has taken
place in case where such transaction had the effect of directly or indirectly transferring the right of
management or control in relation to the Indian concern; and

476 EP-TL&P
(b) a sum of five hundred thousand rupees in any other case.
These amendments are effective from 1st April, 2016 and accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year
2016-17 and subsequent assessment years.

Clarity regarding source rule in respect of interest received by the non-resident in certain
cases
Section 5 of the Act provide for scope of total income for the purposes of its chargeability to tax. In case of a nonresident person, the chargeability of income in India is on the basis of source rule under which certain categories
of income are deemed to accrue or arise in India.
The existing provisions of section 9 provide for the circumstances under which income is deemed to accrue or
arise in India. Section 9(1) (v) relates specifically to the interest income. The said clause provides that the
income by way of interest is deemed to accrue or arise in India if it is payable by –
(a) the Government ; or
(b) a person who is a resident, except where the interest is payable in respect of any debt incurred, or
moneys borrowed and used, for the purposes of a business or profession carried on by such person
outside India or for the purposes of making or earning any income from any source outside India ; or
(c) a person who is a non-resident, where the interest is payable in respect of any debt incurred, or moneys
borrowed and used, for the purposes of a business or profession carried on by such person in India.
Section 90 of the Act provides that Central Government may enter into an agreement with the Government of
any country or specified territory outside India among other things for providing relief from double taxation. India
has entered into Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) with 92 countries. Further sub-section (2) of
the said section provides that in respect of an assessee to whom such DTAA applies, the provisions of the Act
shall apply to the extent they are more beneficial to him. Therefore, the taxpayer is entitled to relief from the
provisions of the Act if such relief is available under the DTAA and to that extent the provisions of the Act are not
applicable.
Further, income of a non-resident from business activity is taxable in India if it has a business connection in India
in accordance with the provisions contained in section 9(1)(i) and only such income is taxable as is attributable
to the business connection. Similarly, under the DTAA income from business activity in the case of a nonresident shall be taxable only if such non-resident has a permanent establishment (PE) in India and only such
income is taxable which is attributable to the PE. The concept of PE is almost on similar lines as business
connection with variations as per different DTAAs. The DTAA further provides the manner of computation of
income attributable to the PE. It is provided that for the purpose of computation of income the PE shall be
deemed to be an independent enterprise with certain restrictions regarding allowability of expense paid to head
office by the PE. Under DTAAs in case of a banking company the interest paid by a PE to its head office and
other branches is allowed as deduction treating such a permanent establishment as an independent enterprise.
The CBDT, in its Circular No. 740 dated 17/4/1996 had clarified that branch of a foreign company in India is a
separate entity for the purpose of taxation under the Act and accordingly TDS provisions would apply along with
separate taxation of interest paid to head office or other branches of the non-resident, which would be chargeable
to tax in India.
Some of the judicial rulings in this context have held that although under the provisions of the Income-tax law the
payment of interest by the branch to head office is non-deductible under domestic law being payment to the self,
however, such interest is deductible due to computation mechanism provided under the DTAA but it is not
taxable in the hands of the Bank being income generated from self. The view expressed in the CBDT circular
has not found favour in these judicial decisions. If the legal fiction created under the treaty is treated to be of
limited effect, it would lead to base erosion. The interest paid by the permanent establishment to the head office

Lesson 9

Computation of Tax Liability of Non-resident Assessees

477

or other branch etc. is an interest payment sourced in India and is liable to be taxed under the source rule in
India. This position is also recognised in some of our DTAAs in particular the Indo-USA DTAA in Article 14 (3)
reads as under:“In the case of a banking company which is resident of the United States, the interest paid by the permanent
establishment of such a company in India to the head office may be subject in India to tax in addition to the tax
imposable under the other provisions of this Convention at a rate which shall not exceed the rate specified in
paragraph 2(a) of Article 11 (Interest)”
The Special Bench of the ITAT in the case of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation [136 ITD- 66 TBOM] had
mentioned that there are instances of other countries providing for specific provisions in their domestic law
which allows for the taxability of interest paid by a permanent establishment to its head office and other branches
and had pointed out absence of such a specific provision in the Income-tax Act.
Considering that there are several disputes on the issue which are pending and likely to arise in future, it is
essential that necessary clarity and certainty is provided for in the Act. Accordingly, an amendment is made in
the Act to provide that, in the case of a non-resident, being a person engaged in the business of banking, any
interest payable by the permanent establishment in India of such non-resident to the head office or any permanent
establishment or any other part of such non-resident outside India shall be deemed to accrue or arise in India
and shall be chargeable to tax in addition to any income attributable to the permanent establishment in India and
the permanent establishment in India shall be deemed to be a person separate and independent of the nonresident person of which it is a permanent establishment and the provisions of the Act relating to computation of
total income, determination of tax and collection and recovery would apply . Accordingly, the PE in India shall be
obligated to deduct tax at source on any interest payable to either the head office or any other branch or PE, etc.
of the non-resident outside India. Further, non-deduction would result in disallowance of interest claimed as
expenditure by the PE and may also attract levy of interest and penalty in accordance with relevant provisions of
the Act.
These amendments are effective from 1st April, 2016 and accordingly, apply to the assessment year 2016-17
and subsequent assessment years.

Fund Managers in India not to constitute business connection of offshore funds
Section 9 of the Act deal with cases of income which are deemed to accrue or arise in India and section 9(1) (i)
provides a set of circumstances in which income is deemed to accrue or arise in India, and is taxable in India.
One of the conditions for the income of a non-resident to be deemed to accrue or arise in India is the existence
of a business connection in India. Once such a business connection is established, income attributable to the
activities which constitute business connection becomes taxable in India. Similarly, under Double Taxation
Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs), the source country assumes taxation rights on certain incomes if the nonresident has a Permanent Establishment (PE) in that country.
Further, section 6 of the Act provides for conditions under which a person is said to be resident in India. In the
case of a person other than an individual, the test is dependent upon the location of its “control and management”.
In the case of off-shore funds, under the existing provisions, the presence of a fund manager in India may create
sufficient nexus of the off-shore fund with India and may constitute a business connection in India even though
the fund manager may be an independent person. Similarly, if the fund manager located in India undertakes
fund management activity in respect of investments outside India for an off-shore fund, the profits made by the
fund from such investments may be liable to tax in India due to the location of fund manager in India and
attribution of such profits to the activity of the fund manager undertaken on behalf of the off-shore fund. Therefore,
apart from taxation of income received by the fund manager as fees for fund management activity, income of offshore fund from investments made in countries outside India may also get taxed in India due to such fund
management activity undertaken in, and from, India constituting a business connection. Further, presence of the

478 EP-TL&P
fund manager under certain circumstances may lead to the off shore fund being held to be resident in India on
the basis of its control and management being in India.
There are a large number of fund managers who are of Indian origin and are managing the investment of
offshore funds in various countries. These persons are not locating in India due to the above tax consequence
in respect of income from the investments of offshore funds made in other jurisdictions.
In order to facilitate location of fund managers of off-shore funds in India a specific regime has been provided in
the Act in line with international best practices with the objective that, subject to fulfillment of certain conditions
by the fund and the fund manager,(i) the tax liability in respect of income arising to the Fund from investment in India would be neutral to the
fact as to whether the investment is made directly by the fund or through engagement of Fund manager
located in India; and
(ii) that income of the fund from the investments outside India would not be taxable in India solely on the
basis that the Fund management activity in respect of such investments have been undertaken through
a fund manager located in India.
The regime provides that in the case of an eligible investment fund, the fund management activity carried out
through an eligible fund manager acting on behalf of such fund shall not constitute business connection in India
of the said fund.
Further, it has been provided that an eligible investment fund shall not be said to be resident in India merely
because the eligible fund manager undertaking fund management activities on its behalf is located in India. This
specific exception from the general rules for determination of business connection and ‘resident status’ of offshore funds and fund management activity undertaken on its behalf is subject to the following:(1) The offshore fund shall be required to fulfill the following conditions during the relevant year for being an
eligible investment fund:
(i) the fund is not a person resident in India;

(xi) the fund shall not carry on or control and manage, directly or indirectly, any business in India or from
India;
(xii) the fund is neither engaged in any activity which constitutes a business connection in India nor has
any person acting on its behalf whose activities constitute a business connection in India other than
the activities undertaken by the eligible fund manager on its behalf.
(xiii) the remuneration paid by the fund to an eligible fund manager in respect of fund management
activity undertaken on its behalf is not less than the arm’s length price of such activity.
(2) The following conditions shall be required to be satisfied by the person being the fund manager for

within ninety days from the end of the financial year, a statement in the prescribed form to the prescribed
income-tax authority containing information relating to the fulfillment of the above conditions or any information
or document which may be prescribed.
In case of non furnishing of the prescribed information or document or statement, a penalty of Rs. 5 lakh shall be
leviable on the fund. It has also been provided to clarify that this regime shall not have any impact on taxability
of any income of the eligible investment fund which would have been chargeable to tax irrespective of whether
the activity of the eligible fund manager constituted the business connection in India of such fund or not. Further,
the regime shall not have any effect on the scope of total income or determination of total income in the case of
the eligible fund manager.
These amendments are effective from 1st April, 2016 and accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year
2016-17 and subsequent assessment years.

DOUBLE TAXATION RELIEF
Double taxation arises where various sovereign countries exercise their power to subject the same person to taxes
of a similar character on the same income. This may happen when he is taxed on the basis of his personal status,
i.e., his nationality, domicile or residence as well as on the basis of place where the income is earned or received.
To avoid double taxation of the same income in two countries, the Central Government may enter into an
agreement with the Government of any Country outside India:
(a) for the grant of relief in respect of income on which income-tax has been paid both under this Act
and Income-tax Act in that country, or
(b) for the avoidance of double taxation of income under this Act and under the corresponding law in
force in that country.
In pursuance of Section 90, agreements for grant of relief on double taxation and agreement for avoidance of
double taxation are executed by the Government of India from time to time. Some of the countries with which
such agreements are in force are: Canada, Korea, New Zealand, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Sri
Lanka, Swiss Federal Council, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Great Britain, Norway, Japan, The Federal Republic

480 EP-TL&P
of Germany, Republic of Austria, Greece, Romania, Republic of Lebanon, United Arab Republic, French
Republic, Iran, Libya, Malaysia, Singapore, Tanzania, Zambia, Australia, Bulgaria, Ethiopia, Italy, Kuwait,
USA, USSR etc.

DEDUCTIONS OF HEAD OFFICE EXPENDITURE IN CASE OF NON-RESIDENTS (SECTION 44C)
In case of foreign companies having branches in India, deduction in respect of head office expenditure is allowed
in computing their income. Section 44C puts a ceiling on such deduction. Accordingly, in the case of assessee
being a non-resident, while computing profits and gains of business, deduction in respect of head office expenditure
shall not be allowed in excess of the following:
(a) an amount equal to 5% of the adjusted total income, or
(b) head office expenditure attributable to the business or profession of the assessee in India, whichever is
the least.
In a case where the adjusted total income of the assessee is a loss, the amount under clause (a) shall be
computed @ 5% of the average adjusted total income of the assessee. The term ‘head office expenditure’
means executive and general administration expenditure incurred by the assessee outside India including
expenditure incurred in respect of the following:
(a) Rent, rates, taxes, repairs or insurance of premises outside India used for the purposes of the business
or profession;
(b) Salary, wages, annuity, pension, fees, bonus, commission, gratuity, perquisites or profits in lieu of or in
addition to salary, whether paid or allowed to any employee or other person employed in, or managing
the affairs of any office outside India;
(c) Travelling by any employee or other person employed in or managing the affairs of any office outside
India; and
(d) Such other matters connected with executive and general administration as may be prescribed.

MODE OF ASSESSMENT
A non-resident can be taxed either directly or through his agent. Where there is no duly constituted agent in
India, the A.O. may statutorily treat any of the following persons as an agent:
(i) who is employed by or on behalf of the non-resident; or
(ii) who has any business connection with the non-resident (he may reside any where in the world); or
(iii) from or through whom the non-resident is in receipt of any income whether directly or indirectly; or
(iv) who is the trustee of the non-resident; or
(v) who has acquired by means of a transfer a capital asset in India. Such person (transferee) may be
resident or non-resident in India.
However, a broker in India who, in respect of any transactions, does not deal directly with or on behalf of a nonresident principal but deals with or through a non-resident broker shall not be deemed to be statutory agent of
non-resident, if:
(i) the transactions are carried on in the ordinary course of business through the Indian Broker; and
(ii) the non-resident broker is carrying on such transactions in the ordinary course of his business and not
as a principal.
If the A.O. wants to treat a person as the agent of a non-resident, he must serve on that person a notice of his

Lesson 9

Computation of Tax Liability of Non-resident Assessees

481

intention of treating him as the agent of non-resident and give him an opportunity of being heard as to his liability.
If the deemed agent is not satisfied by the order of the A.O., he may appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner
against treating him as the agent of a non-resident.
An agent shall be subject to the same duties, responsibilities and liabilities as if the income were income received
by or accruing to or in favour of him beneficially, i.e., submission of return, payment of advance tax, payment of
tax on regular assessment, recovery of tax, reassessment, etc. He shall be liable to assessment in his own
name and any such assessment shall be deemed to be made upon him in his representative capacity and the
tax shall be levied and recovered from him in like manner and to the same extent as it would be leviable upon
and recoverable from the person represented by him. However, his liability shall be restricted for the year for
which he has been deemed to be an agent of the non-resident, after issuance to him of a notice to that effect by
the A.O. If the A.O. wants to treat him as an agent of the non-resident for the following year also, a fresh notice
for the purpose must be served upon him. Whenever he has been appointed an agent before the end of the
previous year, he shall be liable for the payment of tax in advance.

RIGHTS OF AN AGENT
(i) Where an agent pays any sum under this Act on behalf of a non- resident, he shall be entitled to
recover the sum so paid from the person on whose behalf it is paid, or to retain out of any money that
may be in his possession or may come to him in his representative capacity, an amount equal to the
sum so paid.
(ii) Any person who apprehends that he may be assessed as an agent may retain out of any money
payable by him to the principal, a sum equal to his estimated tax liability. In case of disagreement
between the principal and the agent as to the amount to be so retained, the agent may secure from the
A.O. a certificate stating the amount to be so retained pending final settlement of the liability. The certificate
so obtained shall be his warrant for retaining that amount.
The amount recoverable from the agent at the time of final settlement shall not exceed the amount specified in
the certificate, except to the extent to which the agent at such time has in his hands additional assets of the
principal. The liability of the statutory agent is personal and not conditional upon his having in hand any funds of
the non-resident. If he fails to recover the amount of tax paid by him from the non- resident (on whose behalf it
has been paid), he cannot claim it as a bad debt or as a business loss on ordinary principles of commercial
accounting.

INCOMES ESCAPING ASSESSMENT
Where the income of non-resident has escaped assessment, a notice to the statutory agent of the non-resident
for assessment or reassessment cannot be issued after expiry of a period of two years from the end of the
relevant assessment year.

RECOVERY OF TAX
The tax on the income of a non-resident may be recovered as follows:
(i) Deduction of tax at source: The amount of tax should be deducted at the prescribed rates by the person
who makes the payment to a non-resident.
(ii) From his Agent or Assets: All property in India belonging to the non-resident principal can be proceeded
against for the recovery of tax, on the basis of the assessment made against his statutory agent.
(iii) Where any property of the non-resident principal is vested in the representative assessee or is under
the control or management of the representative assessee, the same may be proceeded against, whether
the demand is raised against the representative assessee or against, the beneficiary direct.

482 EP-TL&P
(iv) If there is no property in India of the non-resident at the time of making an assessment, the Assessing
Officer may wait till any property of the non-resident comes into India.
The ordinary period of limitation applicable to the commencement of proceedings to recover tax is one year from
the end of the financial year in which the demand is made. However, arrears of tax assessed on a statutory
agent in respect of income deemed to accrue or arise in India may be recovered from any assets of the nonresident which are, or may, at any time come within India. Consequently, such tax may be realised irrespective
of any limitation by way of time.

LESSON ROUND UP
– The foreign investors may be Indian Nationals who reside outside India and other foreign investors
including corporations. A person who resides outside India is technically known as “non-resident”. The
residential status of an individual does not depend upon the nationality or domicile of that person but
it depends upon his stay in India during the previous year.
– A non-resident is not liable to pay tax on his foreign income until and unless it is received in India.
Further, remittances to India in any previous year out of earlier year’s income, i.e. Income received
and/or earned abroad in earlier years, are not charged to Indian Income-tax.
– The Act has provided a large number of concessions to foreigners on their income earned in India.
– Chapter XII-A containing 7 Sections from 115C to 115-I contains special provisions relating to certain
incomes of non-resident Indian.
– A non-resident Indian is not required to furnish his return of income u/s 139(1) if his total income in
respect of which he is assessable under this Act during the previous year consists only of investment
income and the tax at source has been deducted under the provisions of Chapter XVII-B.
– Double taxation arises where various sovereign countries exercise their power to subject the same
person to taxes of a similar character on the same income.
– In case of foreign companies having branches in India, deduction in respect of head office expenditure
is allowed in computing their income. Section 44C puts a ceiling on such deduction.
– A non-resident can be taxed either directly or through his agent. Where there is no duly constituted
agent in India, the A.O. may statutorily treat any of the following persons as an agent:
(i) who is employed by or on behalf of the non-resident; or
(ii) who has any business connection with the non-resident (he may reside any where in the world); or
(iii) from or through whom the non-resident is in receipt of any income whether directly or indirectly; or
(iv) who is the trustee of the non-resident; or
(v) who has acquired by means of a transfer a capital asset in India. Such person (transferee) may be
resident or non-resident in India.

When any tax, interest penalty, fine or any other sum is payable in consequence of any order passed under this
Act, the Assessing Officer shall serve upon the assessee a notice of demand in the prescribed form specifying
the sum so payable.
Provided that where any sum is determined to be payable by the assessee or [the deductor or the collector
under sub-section (1) of section 143 or sub-section (1) of section 200A or sub-section (1) of section 206CB], the
intimation under those sub-sections shall be deemed to be a notice of demand for the purposes of this section.

(b) Intimation of loss (Section 157)
When in the course of the assessment of the total income of any assessee, it is established that a loss has taken
place which the assessee is entitled to have carried forward and set off against the income in subsequent years,

assessee shall be deemed to be in default and shall be liable to pay in addition to the amount of the arrears and
the amount of interest, by way of penalty such amount as the Assessing Officer may direct. In the case of
continuing default, he shall be liable to pay such further amount as the Assessing Officer may, from time to time,
direct. However, the total amount of penalty shall not exceed the amount of tax in arrears.
Where an assessee is in default or is deemed to be in default in making a payment of tax, the Tax Recovery
Officer may draw up under his signature a statement in the prescribed form specifying the amount of arrears due
from the assessee and shall proceed to recover from such assessee the amount specified in the certificate

Provided further that no order rejecting the application, either in full or in part, shall be passed unless the
assessee has been given an opportunity of being heard. Provided also that where any application is pending as
on the 1st day of June, 2016, the order shall be passed on or before the 31st day of May, 2017.

PAYMENT OF INCOME-TAX
The Income-tax Act provides for collection and recovery of income-tax in the following ways, namely,
(i) deduction of tax at source in respect of income by way of salaries, interest on securities, interest other
than interest on securities, winnings from lotteries and crossword puzzles, winnings from horse-race,
insurance commission, dividends, payment to contractors or subcontractors and payments to nonresidents;
(ii) advance payment of income-tax before the assessment by the assessee himself;
(iii) direct payment of income-tax by the assessee on self-assessment; and
(iv) after the assessment is made by the Assessing Officer.
The provisions relating to tax deduction at source and payment of tax in advance of assessment are being
discussed below:

Deduction of Tax at Source
Sections 192 to 206 of the Income-tax Act lay down the provisions relating to deduction of tax at source. The
provisions in respect of different incomes are as follows:

(1) Salary (Section 192)
(i) Any person responsible for paying any income (employer) chargeable under the head “Salaries” shall,
at the time of payment, deduct income-tax on the amount payable at the average rates applicable to the
estimated income of the assessee (employee) under this head for that financial year. It is not the total
income that is subject to deduction of tax at source but the estimated income under the head “Salaries”
that is important. W.e.f. August 1, 1998, an assessee having an income under the head ‘salaries’ may
furnish in the prescribed manner giving the details of the losses under the head ‘Income from House

490 EP-TL&P
Property’ to the person responsible for making the payment who shall taking into account such loss for
the purposes of computing the tax deductible from salaries, which may be reduced in such a case.
Only where the loss under the head “Income from House Property” has been taken into account TDS
deductible from the head salaries may be reduced due to such loss taken into account. For this purpose
the salary shall be computed in the same manner as discussed under the head ‘Salaries’. From such
salary the following deductions shall be made:
(a) amount deductible Sections 80C, 80D, 80DD and 80DDB.
(b) deduction under Section 80G, in respect of donations made to the National Defence Fund, Jawahar
Lal Nehru Memorial Fund, the Prime Minister’s Drought Relief Fund etc. subject to conditions laid
down under Section 80G;
(c) deduction under Section 80GG in respect of rent paid;
(e) deduction under Section 80U on production of a certificate by the employee from the Assessing
Officer authorising such deduction. Certificate need not be produced by individuals who have
already produced a certificate under the old provision applicable upto 1991-92 assessment year.
(ii) The employer may, at the time of making any deduction, increase or reduce the amount to be deducted
for the purpose of adjusting any excess or deficiency arising out of any previous deductions or failure to
deduct during the financial year.
(iii) The trustees of a recognised provident fund or an approved superannuation fund shall deduct the tax at
the time of the accumulated balance due to an employee is paid provided it is not exempted.
No tax will be required to be deducted at source in case the Total income does not exceeds
– ` 2,50,000 in case of individual below 60 years of age.
– ` 3,00,000 in case of individual having the age of 60 years but below 80 years
– ` 5,00,000 in case of individual having the age of 80 years and above.
Where the salary is payable to an assessee outside India in foreign currency its value in rupees shall be the
telegraphic transfer buying rate of such currency as on the date on which the tax is required to be deducted at
source. ‘Telegraphic transfer buying rate’ means the rate of exchange adopted by the State Bank of India for
buying such currency as made available to the bank through a telegraphic transfer.
Every employer shall file a quarterly return in Form No. 24Q within 15 days from end of quarter and for the quarter
ending on 31st March will be submitted on 31st May following the close of the relevant financial year showing:
(a) the name and address of every employee who is drawing such amount as may be prescribed;
(b) the amount of income so received by or so due to each such person; and
(c) the amount of tax deducted and deposited from the income of such person.
The employer shall issue a certificate of deduction of tax to the employee in Form No. 16.
Also, a person responsible for paying any income chargeable under the head “Salaries” is required to furnish,
to the person to whom such payment is made, a statement giving correct and complete particulars of
perquisites or profits in lieu of salary provided to him and the value thereof in form 12BA. If PAN is not
furnished then the rate of TDS is average rate or 20% whichever is higher.

(1A) Premature Withdrawal from Employees’ Provident Fund Scheme (EPFS)–Sections 192A
Withdrawal of the accumulated balance lying in a Recognised Provident Fund (RPF) account, is exempt from
tax if the employee renders continuous service with the employer for a period of five years or more. In case of
cessation of employment, if the employee takes up an employment with another employer and the accumulated
balance in her/his RPF account is transferred to her/his RPF account maintained by such other employer, then
also the exemption is available.

Lesson 10

Collection and Recovery of Tax 491

In case the abovementioned conditions are not satisfied, the accumulated balance due to the employee is
taxable in the hands of the employee. In such a case, tax is required to be calculated by re-computing the tax
liability of the years for which the contribution to RPF has been made, by treating the same as contribution to
unrecognised provident fund.
The trustees of an RPF are required to deduct tax at source on such accumulated balance at the time it is paid,
as if such withdrawn amount were income chargeable under the head Salaries. However, often, the trustees did
not have the requisite information to be in a position to compute the TDS correctly. With a view to simplify the
process of deduction in such cases, Section 192A has been inserted w.e.f 1.06.2015 to provide that trustees of
RPFs shall, at the time of payment of the accumulated balance due to the employee, deduct tax at source at the
rate of 10%, where the aggregate withdrawal is Rs. 30,000/- or more. The limit of Rs. 30,000 has been increased
to 50,000. (Amendment vide Finance Act, 2016 w.e.f. 1st June, 2016)
At the same time, if the concerned employee fails to furnish her/his permanent account number (PAN) to the
person responsible for deducting such tax, then tax shall be deducted at the rate of 20% as per Section 206AA.
It has also been provided that tax shall not be deducted if the employee furnishes to the payer a self-declaration
in the prescribed Form No. 15G/15H, declaring that the tax on her/his estimated total income of the relevant
previous year would be nil.

(2) Interest on Securities (Section 193)

credit of such income to the account of the payee or at the time of payment thereof in cash or by issue of a
cheque or draft or by any other mode, whichever is earlier deduct income-tax at the rates in force on the amount
of the interest payable.
Credit of any income by way of interest on securities to any account, whether called “Interest payable account”
or “Suspense account” or by any other name in the books of account of the person liable to pay such income, is,
for the purposes of Section 193, deemed to be credit of such income to the payee and attracts applicability of the
provisions of Section 193.
However, tax shall not be deducted from the interest on the following securities:
(i) Debentures issued by Co-operative Society (including Co-operative Land Mortgage Banks or Cooperative Land Development Banks) or any other institution or authority as the Central Government

The aforesaid limits were computed with reference to the income credited or paid by a branch of the
banking company or the cooperative society, as the case may be. Many bank depositors avoided TDS
from interest on bank fixed deposits by splitting their deposits amongst different branches of the same
bank. With a view to curbing this practice, Finance Act, 2015 has inserted a proviso to Section 194A(3)
to provide that TDS under Section 194A will be with reference to income credited or paid by the banks
as a whole (in those cases where core banking solutions have been adopted by the concerned bank).

RATIONALIZATION OF TAX DEDUCTION AT SOURCE PROVISIONS RELATING TO PAYMENTS
BY CATEGORY-I AND CATEGORY-II ALTERNATE INVESTMENT FUNDS TO ITS INVESTORS
The Finance Act, 2015 had inserted a special taxation regime in respect of Category-I and II Alternative Investment
Funds (investment fund) registered with SEBI. The special taxation regime is intended to ensure tax pass through
status in respect of these investment funds which are collective investment vehicles. The special regime is contained
in sections 10(23FBA), 10(23FBB), 115UB and 194LBB of the Act. Under this regime, the income of the investment
fund (not being in the nature of business income) is exempt in the hands of investment fund but income received
by the investor from the investment fund (other than income which is taxed at the level of investment fund) is

502 EP-TL&P
taxable in the hands of investor. The taxation in the hands of investors is in the same manner and in the same
proportion as it would have been, had the investor received such income directly and not through the investment
fund. The existing provisions of section 194LBB provides that in respect of any income credited or paid by the
investment fund to its investor, a tax deduction at source (TDS) shall be made by the investment fund @ 10% of the
income. Under section 197 of the Act, facility for certificate for deduction of tax at lower rate or no deduction is
available in respect of sections enumerated therein, if the Assessing Officer is satisfied that total income of the
recipient justifies issue of such certificate, section 194LBB is currently not included in this provision.
It has been represented that the existing TDS regime has created certain difficulties. The non-resident investor
is not able to claim benefit of lower or NIL rate of taxation which is available to him under the relevant Double
Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), and deduction of tax @10% is to be undertaken mandatorily even if
under DTAA, the income is not taxable in India. There is no facility for any investor to approach the Assessing
Officer for seeking certificate for TDS at a lower or NIL rate in respect of deductions made under section 194LBB.
In order to rationalise the TDS regime in respect of payments made by the investment funds to its investors,
section 194LBB of the Act has been amended to provide that the person responsible for making the payment to
the investor shall deduct income-tax under section 194LBB at the rate of ten per cent where the payee is a
resident and at the rates in force where the payee is a non-resident (not being a company) or a foreign company.
Further, it is provided to amend section 197 to include section 194LBB in the list of sections for which a certificate
for deduction of tax at lower rate or no deduction of tax can be obtained. Consequential changes are also made
to the definition of “rates in force” so as to include section 194LBB in it.
These amendments will take effect from 1st June, 2016.

(26) No deduction to be made in certain cases
Section 197A provides that no deduction of tax at source is to be made from (i) interest on securities, (ii)
dividends, and (iii) payments in respect of deposits under NSS, etc. if the following conditions are satisfied:
(i) The recipient of such income is an individual and resident in India.
(ii) Such person furnishes a declaration in writing in duplicate, in the prescribed form and verified in the
prescribed manner, to the payer of such income to the effect that the tax on his estimated total income
of the previous year in which such income is to be included for computing his total income will be nil.
Sub-section 197A(1A) has been inserted with effect from June 1, 1992. This sub-section provides that in case of
interest other than interest on securities, a declaration referred to above can be furnished by any person (other
than a company or a firm).
The payer of the aforesaid income will deliver to Chief Commissioner or Commissioner of Income-tax one copy
of the declaration (received from the recipient of income) on or before the 7th day of the month next following the
month in which the declaration is furnished. If he fails to do so he will be liable to a penalty of an amount which
shall not be less then one hundred rupees but which may extend to two hundred rupees for every day during
which the default continues.

(27) Tax deducted is income received (Section 198)
The tax deducted at source is deemed to be the income received, by the assessee for the purpose of computing
his income.

(28) Certificate of tax deducted (Section 203)
The person who deducts tax has to issue a certificate in the prescribed form to the person from whose
payments deduction has been made, showing therein the particulars of payment, the date of tax deducted at
source and the date of its credit to the Central Government. It is on the basis of this certificate that the payee

Lesson 10

Collection and Recovery of Tax 503

can claim credit for tax paid on his behalf and can claim refund, if any, due to him on the basis of tax liability
for the relevant year.

(29) Consequence in the event of default (Section 201)
Where any person, including the principal officer of a company,
(a) who is required to deduct any sum in accordance with the provisions of this Act; or
(b) referred to in sub-section (1A) of section 192, being an employer,
does not deduct, or does not pay, or after so deducting fails to pay, the whole or any part of the tax, as required
by or under this Act, then, such person, shall, without prejudice to any other consequences which he may incur,
be deemed to be an assessee in default in respect of such tax:
However, any person, including the principal officer of a company, who fails to deduct the whole or any part of
the tax in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter on the sum paid to a resident or on the sum credited to
the account of a resident shall not be deemed to be an assessee in default in respect of such tax if such resident
(i) has furnished his return of income under section 139;
(ii) has taken into account such sum for computing income in such return of income; and
(iii) has paid the tax due on the income declared by him in such return of income,
and the person furnishes a certificate to this effect from an accountant in form 26A.
No penalty shall be charged under section 221 from such person, unless the Assessing Officer is satisfied that
such person, without good and sufficient reasons, has failed to deduct and pay such tax.
No order shall be made deeming a person to be an assessee in default for failure to deduct the whole or any part
of the tax from a person resident in India, at any time after the expiry of seven years from the end of the financial
year in which payment is made or credit is given.
If a person responsible for deduction of tax at source fails to deduct the appropriate tax or, after making the due
deduction fails to deposit it into the Government treasury, he shall be deemed to be an assessee in default and
shall be liable to:
(i) Payment of the whole or any part of the tax as due
(ii) Interest at the rate of 1 per cent per month or part of the month on the tax from the date on which such
tax was deductible to the date on which such tax is deducted; and
(iii) Interest at the rate of 1½ per cent per month or part of the month on the tax from the date on which such
tax was deducted to the date on which such tax is actually paid;
However, in case any person, including the principal officer of a company fails to deduct the whole or
any part of the tax on the sum paid to a resident or on the sum credited to the account of a resident but
is not deemed to be an assessee in default, the interest shall be payable from the date on which such
tax was deductible to the date of furnishing of return of income by such resident.
(iv) Penalty which may be as high as the amount of the tax in default, however, no penalty shall be charged
under Section 221 from such person unless the Assessing Officer is satisfied that such person has,
without good and sufficient reasons, failed to deduct and pay the tax; and
(v) Prosecution - where the amount of tax which the responsible person has failed to deduct or pay
exceeds ` 1,00,000 he shall be punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than 6
months but which may be extended to 7 years and with fine. In any other case, he shall be punished
with a rigorous imprisonment of a term of not less than 3 months but which may be extended to 3
years and with fine.

504 EP-TL&P

Whether tax collection at source (‘TCS’)
at the rate of 1 % is on sale of Motor
Vehicle at retail level or also on sale of
motor vehicles by manufacturers to

sales and accordingly it will not apply on sale of
motor vehicles by manufacturers to dealers/
distributors

sale of Motor Vehicle is applicable only
to Luxury Cars?

No, it’s applicable on sale of any motor vehicle of
the value exceeding ten lakh rupees,

3.

Embassies, Consulates and United Nation
Institutions for sale of motor vehicle or
any other goods or provision of services?

No

Questions

Answer
year in which the motor vehicle is sold shall be liable
for collection of tax at source on sale of motor
vehicle by him.

6.

How would the provisions of TCS on sale of
motor vehicle be applicable in a case where
part of the payment is made in cash and
part is made by cheque?

The provisions of TCS on sale of motor vehicle
exceeding ten lakh rupees are not dependent on
mode of payment. Any sale of Motor Vehicle
exceeding ten lakh would attract TCS @ 1%.

7.

As per section 206C(1D), tax is to be
collected at source @ 1 % if sale
consideration received in cash exceeds two
lakh rupees whereas as per section 206C(lF)
tax is to be collected at source @ 1% of the
sale consideration of a motor vehicle
exceeding 10 lakh rupees. Whether TCS
will be made under both sub-section (lD)
and (IF) of the section 206C @ 2%, where
part of the payment for purchase of motor
vehicle exceeds 2 lakh rupees in cash?

Sub-section (1F) of the section 206C of the Act
provides for TCS @ 1% on sale of motor vehicle
of value exceeding 10 lakh rupees. This is
irrespective of the mode of payment. Thus if the
value of motor vehicle is 20 lakh rupees, out of
which 5 lakh rupees has been paid in cash and
balance amount by way of cheque, the tax shall
be collected at source @ 1 % on total sale
consideration of 20 lakh rupees only under subsection (IF) of section 206C of the Act. However,
if a vehicle is sold for 8 lakh rupees and the
consideration is paid in cash, tax shall be
collected at source @ 1 % on 8 lakh rupees as
per sub-section (lD) of section 206C of the Act.

No

2.

Whether tax collection at source (‘TCS’)
u/s 206C(1D) @ 1% will apply only on

Step 3: Advance Tax Instalments - Advance Tax is payable as follows:
Note: Advance Tax is payable by all Assessee in four instalments during the previous year i.e. by 15th June
(15%), 15th September (45%), 15th December (75%) and 15th March (100%). However, in case of LTCG
arising after one or more instalments, advance tax on instalments prior to date of LTCG can be paid without
including tax on LTCG and advance tax on instalments after LTCG must be paid in the remaining instalments on
the amount of total tax liability including that on LTCG.
Therefore, in this case, advance tax payable by 1st and 2nd instalment would be based on Tax excluding Tax on
LTCG and advance tax payable by 3rd and 4th instalment would be based on tax including tax on LTCG.
Tax excluding tax on LTCG: ` 5,23,500 + Cess @ 3% = 5,39,205 -TDS ` 60,000 = ` 4,79,205 [` 4,79,210 after

REFUNDS (SECTIONS 237 to 245)
Refund means “to repay” or restore what was taken under the income-tax law. Refunds arise in those cases
where the amount of tax paid by a person or on his behalf is greater than the amount with which he is properly
chargeable for that year. Under the following circumstances the refunds may become due:
(i) The tax deducted at source is higher than the amount of tax payable, as determined on regular
assessment;
(ii) The amount of advance tax paid or tax paid on the basis of self- assessment exceeds the tax payable as
determined on regular assessment;
(iii) The tax determined and paid on the basis of regular assessment gets reduced as a result of rectification
of mistake which had crept in the assessment or is reduced in appeal or revision;
(iv) The same income is taxed in India and in a foreign country and the assessee is entitled to double
taxation relief.
For claiming refund it is necessary that the income in respect of which refund of tax is being claimed must have
been included in his total income as per the return of Income.
Every claim for refund under this chapter shall be made in the prescribed Form (No. 30) within one year from the
last day of the assessment year to which the claim is related. If the assessee has not filed the return of income
he must file the return alongwith the certificate/s of tax deducted at source, challans for payment of tax, salary
certificate and/or tax paid in a foreign country. The dividend warrants and other certificates should be filed in
original, duly signed by the assessee, to evidence the ownership of shares etc., from which the income is
derived. If, for some reason, the original certificates are not traceable, duplicates issued by the concerned
companies may be furnished. However, in such cases an indemnity bond stating that the original certificates are
not traceable and no refund in respect of such warrants had already been claimed, should also accompany the
claim. Indemnity bond should be on a stamp paper of the prescribed value depending upon the amount of tax
deduction.
Where refund arises on completion of assessment on account of excess payments of advance tax or on selfassessment or it results on account of reduction in appeal, revision or rectification of mistakes, no formal application
for refund is required. The Assessing Officer shall grant such refund on his own. However, where an assessment
is set aside or cancelled by virtue of such an order and an order of fresh assessment is directed to be made, the
refund if any, shall become due only on the making of fresh assessment. In cases where the assessment is
annulled, the refund shall become due only of the amount of tax paid in excess of the tax chargeable on the total
income returned by the assessee (Section 240).
However, the assessing officer is authorised to admit a belated refund claim subject to satisfying the following
conditions:
(a) the refund arising as a tax deducted at source under Section 192, 193, 194, 194A, 194B, 194C, 194D
and 195 or as a result of excess advance tax payments under Section 208, does not exceed ` 10,000;
(b) the returned income is not a loss, where the assessee claims the benefit of carry forward of the loss;
(c) the refund claimed is not supplementary in nature i.e. a claim for additional amount of refund after the
completion of the original assessment for the same year; and
(d) the income of the assessee is not assessable in the hands of any other person under any provisions of
the Act.

Whom to apply for refund?
Claim for refund should be preferred to the Assessing Officer having jurisdiction to assess the assessee.

Lesson 10

Collection and Recovery of Tax 513

In bigger towns like Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, separate Refund Circles have been opened to settle
refund cases. However, these circles settle refund cases where income is restricted to ‘Other Sources’.

Who is entitled to refund?
Any one of the following persons can apply for the refund:
(i) Owner of the income who has made excess payment;
(ii) Where the income of a person is included in the hands of another, only the latter is entitled to refund;
(iii) In case of death of the assessee, his legal representative;
(iv) In case of insolvency of the assessee - the receiver;
(v) In case of liquidation of a company - the liquidator of the company;
(vi) In case of minor or incapable assessee - the guardian of the minor or incapable;
(vii) In case of non-resident assessee - his agent provided he has been duly authorised by the principal; and
(viii) In case of dissolved partnership firm - any partner provided he has been duly authorised by all other expartners of the firm.

Issue of Refund
If the Assessing Officer is satisfied that the refund claim is complete and in order, he shall complete the assessment
and issue a refund voucher payable at the Reserve Bank or the State Bank or any treasury. The refund voucher
is encashable like any other cheque, within three months from the date of issue. If the assessee fails to encash
it within the prescribed time (3 months from the date of issue), he should send it to the Assessing Officer who will
cancel it and issue a fresh one. If the applicant is a resident and the amount of refund is small, the amount may
be sent by money order at Government cost. Where the assessee is a non-resident, generally a Bank Draft is
sent at his cost.

Adjustment of Refund
All refunds may not be settled by actual payments. Wherever it is found that tax for some other years (either
earlier or subsequent to the year to which the refund relates) are outstanding against the assessee, the refund
due may be adjusted against the outstanding demand and the balance, if any, refunded to him. However, the
amount can be adjusted only after giving an intimation in writing to the assessee of the action proposed to be
taken for the purpose.

Interest on Refunds
Section 244A, provides that where, in pursuance of any order passed under the Income-tax Act, refund of any
amount becomes due to the assessee, he shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the said amount, simple
interest thereon calculated in the following manner:
(a) Where the refund is out of any tax collected at source under Section 206C or paid by way of advance tax
or treated as paid under Section 199, during the financial year immediately preceding the assessment
year, interest calculated at the rate of one half per cent for every month or part of a month comprised in
the period from 1st day of April of the assessment year to the date on which the refund is granted. But,

interest shall be payable.

(5) of section 153, the assessee shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the interest payable under
sub-section (1) of section 244A, an additional interest on such refund amount calculated @ 3% per
annum, for the period beginning from the date following the date of expiry of the time allowed under subsection (5) of section 153 to the date on which the refund is granted. It is clarified that in cases where
extension is granted by the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner by invoking proviso to sub-section
(5) of section 153, the period of additional interest, if any, shall begin from the expiry of such extended
period [Amendment vide Finance Act, 2016 w.e.f. 1st June, 2016].
(e) The assessee is not entitled to any interest on refund where a delay in payment thereof takes place for
reasons attributable to the assessee. Any question as to the period to be excluded has to be decided by
the Chief Commissioner or Commissioner whose decision thereon shall be final.

of an order 143(3); 144; 147; 154; 155; 250; 254; 260; 262; 263; 264; or 245D(4), interest payable is to
be increased or reduced accordingly. In the case of subsequent reduction of the interest, the Assessing
Officer has to serve a demand notice on the assessee requiring him to pay back such amount as has
been paid in excess.

the 1st day of April, 1989 and subsequent years. However, in respect of assessment of fringe benefits, the

According to that section, it is statutorily obligatory for every person being a company or a firm or being a person
other than a company or firm to furnish a return of his total income or the total income of any other person in
respect of which he is assessable under the Income-tax Act, in all cases where his total income or the total
income of any other person for which he is liable to be assessed exceeds, in any relevant accounting year, the
maximum amount which is not chargeable to income-tax. The return of income must be furnished by the assessee
in the prescribed manner by the Board from time to time.
It should be obligatory for the firm to file return of income in every case. Further, in respect of individual, HUF,
AOP, BOI, Artificial juridical Person, filing of return of income shall be compulsory if their total income before

any asset or is a beneficiary of any asset (including any financial interest in any entity) located outside India or
signing authority in any account located outside India.

suggests that “beneficial owner” in respect of an asset means an individual who has provided, directly or indirectly,
consideration for the asset for the immediate or future benefit, direct or indirect, of himself or any other person
and “beneficiary” in respect of an asset means an individual who derives benefit from the asset during the
previous year and the consideration for such asset has been provided by any person other than such beneficiary.

assessee. If the assessee fails to rectify the defect within the aforesaid period, the return shall be deemed to be
invalid and further it shall be deemed that the assessee had failed to furnish the return. However, where the
assessee rectifies the defect after the expiry of the aforesaid period but before the assessment is made, the
Assessing Officer may condone the delay and treat the return as a valid return.

532 EP-TL&P

A return of income is regarded as defective unless the self assessment tax together with interest, if any,
payable in accordance with section 140A has been paid on or before the date of furnishing of return.
Section 139(9) of the Act has been amended to provide that a return which is otherwise valid would not
be treated defective merely because self assessment tax and interest payable in accordance with the

Lesson 11

Procedure for Assessment 533

provisions of section 140A, has not been paid on or before the date of furnishing of the return.

SCHEME TO FACILITATE SUBMISSION OF RETURNS THROUGH TAX RETURN PREPARERS
[SECTION 139B] [W.E.F. 1-6-2006]
W.e.f. 1.6.2006, a new section 139B have been inserted in the Act so as to provide that for the purpose of
enabling any specified class or classes of persons to prepare and furnish returns of income, the Board may, by
way of notification, frame a scheme providing that such persons may furnish their returns of income through a
Tax return preparer authorized to act as such under the scheme. This scheme is not applicable for a company or
a person who is required to undergo a ‘tax audit’ or ‘audit under any other law’.
It has been further provided that the Scheme framed under the said section shall specify the manner in which
the Tax return preparer shall assist the persons furnishing the return of income, and shall also affix his signature
on such return.
A Tax return preparer may be an individual other than a person referred to in clause (ii) or clause (iii) or clause
(iv) of sub-section (2) of section 288 or an employee of the specified class or classes of persons, who has been

TYPES OF ASSESSMENT
(a) Self assessment (Section 140A)
(b) Regular assessment (Section 143)
(c) Best judgement assessment (Section 144)
(d) Income escaping assessment or re-assessment (Section 147)
(e) Precautionary assessment.
(f) Assessment in case of search or requisition (Section 153A)

(A) SELF ASSESSMENT (SECTION 140A)
Self assessment is the first step in the process of assessments. Self Assessment is simply a process where a
person himself assesses his tax liability on the income earned during the particular previous year and submits
Income Tax Return to the department. Every person, before furnishing return under sections 139(return of income),
142(1), 148 (issue of notice where income has escaped assessment) and 153A (Assessment in case of search or
requisition) shall make self assessment of his income and pay the tax, if due on the basis of such assessment. The
total tax payable is calculated on the total income of the assessee after considering the following amount:
(i) the amount of tax already paid under any provision of this Act;
(ii) any tax deducted or collected at source;
(iii) any relief of tax or deduction of tax claimed under section 90 or section 91 on account of tax paid in a
country outside India;
(iv) any relief of tax claimed under section 90A on account of tax paid in any specified territory outside India
referred to in that section; and
(v) any tax credit claimed to be set off in accordance with the provisions of section 115JAA or section 115JD.
Such determined value of tax along with the interest payable under any provision of this Act for any delay in
furnishing the return or any default or delay in payment of advance tax is paid before furnishing the return and
the proof of payment of such tax is attached with the return.
The work of income tax department became easy due to the system of Self Assessment.

(B) SCRUTINY (REGULAR) ASSESSMENT [SECTION 143(2) & (3)]
Where a return has been made under Section 139, or in response to a notice under Sub-section (1) of Section
142, the Assessing Officer shall, if he considers necessary or expedient to ensure that the assessee has not
understated the income or has not computed excessive loss or has not underpaid the tax in any manner, serve
on the assessee a notice requiring him, on a date to be specified therein, either to attend his office or to produce,
or cause to be produced there, any evidence on which the assessee may rely in support of the return:
Provided that no notice under this sub-section shall be served on the assessee after the expiry of six months
from the end of the Financial year in which the return is furnished.
On the day specified in the notice issued under Sub-section (2), or as soon afterwards as may be, after hearing
such evidence as the assessee may produce and such other evidence as the Assessing Officer may require on

Lesson 11

Procedure for Assessment 537

specified points, and after taking into account all relevant material which he has gathered, the Assessing Officer
shall, by an order in writing, make an assessment of the total income or loss of the assessee, and determine the
sum payable by him or refund of any amount due to him on the basis of such assessment.

(C) BEST JUDGEMENT ASSESSMENT U/S 144
The Assessing Officer, after taking into account all relevant material which he has gathered, and after giving the
assessee an opportunity of being heard, makes the assessment of the total income or loss to the best of his
judgment and determine the sum payable by the assessee on the basis of such assessment in the following cases:
– If any person fails to make the return required under section 139(1) and has not made a return or a
revised return under section 139(4) or 139(5), or
– When a person fails to comply with all the terms of a notice issued under section 142(1) or fails to
comply with a direction issued under section 142(2A) for getting the accounts audited, or
– If any person having made a return, fails to comply with all the terms of a notice issued under section
143(2).
Prior to the proceedings the AO should issue a show cause notice to the assessee. However if the assessee
has already issued notice under section 142(1)(i) and the assessee has not complied with the terms then AO
can proceed further without issuing a show cause notice.
Further AO cannot assess the income below returned income and cannot assess losses higher than the returned
losses. A refund cannot be granted under section 144.
The assessing officer can also reject the accounts book under section 145 and can make best judgment
assessment under section 144 if:
– The accounts books are incorrect, false or incomplete.
– If the accounting method employed is such that the profit cannot be derived from it correctly.
– Where the method of accounting adopted by the assessee is not followed by him regularly or income
has not been computed in accordance with notified standards.
– If the assessee has not followed the income computation and disclosure standards notified by the government.
As provided in the Act, GAAR provisions had to come into effect from 1.04.2016. These provisions, therefore,
had to be applicable to the income of the financial year 2015-16 (Assessment Year 2016-1 7) and subsequent
years. However, the implementation of GAAR provisions was reviewed, concerns were expressed regarding
certain aspects of GAAR and it has been proposed that implementation of GAAR be deferred by two years and
GAAR provisions be made applicable to the income of the financial year 2017-18 (Assessment Year 2018-19)
and subsequent years by amendment of the Act. Further, investments made up to 31.03.2017 are proposed to
be protected from the applicability of GAAR by amendment in the relevant rules in this regard.

(D) INCOME ESCAPING ASSESSMENT OR RE-ASSESSMENT (SECTION 147)
If the Assessing Officer has reason to believe that any income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for
any assessment year, he may, subject to the provisions of sections 148 to 153,
– assess or reassess income which has escaped assessment or
– recompute the loss or the depreciation allowance or any other allowance, as the case may be for the
relevant assessment year.
Section 147, the Assessing Officer shall serve on the assessee a notice requiring him to furnish, within such
period, as may be specified in the notice, a return of his income or the income of any other person in respect of
which he is assessable under this Act during the previous year corresponding to the relevant assessment year,

538 EP-TL&P
in the prescribed form, and verified in the prescribed manner and setting forth such other particulars, as may be
prescribed; and the provisions of this Act shall, so far as may be, apply accordingly as if such return were a
return furnished as per the requirements of Section 139.
Provided that in case a summary assessment or reassessment has been made for the relevant assessment
year, no action shall be taken under this section after the expiry of four years from the end of the relevant
assessment year, unless any income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for such assessment year by
reason of the failure on the part of the assessee to make a return under section 139 or in response to a notice
issued under sub-section (1) of section 142 or section 148 or to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary
for his assessment, for that assessment year:
Provided further that nothing contained in the first proviso shall apply in a case where any income in relation to
any asset (including financial interest in any entity) located outside India, chargeable to tax, has escaped
assessment for any assessment year:
Provided also that the Assessing Officer may assess or reassess such income, other than the income involving
matters which are the subject matters of any appeal, reference or revision, which is chargeable to tax and has
escaped assessment.
The following shall also be deemed to be cases where income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment,
namely :
(i) where no return of income has been furnished by the assessee although his total income or the total
income of any other person in respect of which he is assessable under this Act during the previous year
exceeded the maximum amount which is not chargeable to income-tax
(ii) where a return of income has been furnished by the assessee but no assessment has been made and
it is noticed by the Assessing Officer that the assessee has understated the income or has claimed
excessive loss, deduction, allowance or relief in the return
(iii) where the assessee has failed to furnish a report in respect of any international transaction which he
was so required under section 92E
(iv) where an assessment has been made, but
(i) income chargeable to tax has been under assessed ; or
(ii) such income has been assessed at too low a rate ; or
(iii) such income has been made the subject of excessive relief under this Act ; or
(iv) excessive loss or depreciation allowance or any other allowance under this Act has been computed;]
(v) Where a return of income has not been furnished by the assessee or a return of income has been
furnished by him and on the basis of information or document received from the prescribed income-tax
authority, under sub-section (2) of section 133C, it is noticed by the Assessing Officer that the income of
the assessee exceeds the maximum amount not chargeable to tax, or as the case may be, the assessee
has understated the income or has claimed excessive loss, deduction, allowance or relief in the return.
(vi) where a person is found to have any asset (including financial interest in any entity) located outside
India.
The assessing officer before making the assessment under this section will have to issue notice u/s 148 to the
assessee requiring him to file the return even if he has already filed the return under section 139 or 142(1). The
AO is duty bound to provide the assessee the reasons recorded by him, if the assessee request for it. If on
request the reasons are not supplied then AO cannot proceed the assessment. The time limit for issue of notice
under section 148 is as under:

Lesson 11

when the amount is likely to be `100,000

However, the time lime of 6 years is not sufficient in cases where assets are located outside India because
gathering information regarding such assets takes much more time on account of additional procedures and
laws of foreign jurisdictions. Therefore, the time limit for issue of notice for reopening an assessment has been
increased to 16 years, where the income in relation to any asset (including financial interest in any entity)
located outside India, chargeable to tax, has escaped assessment.

RECTIFICATION OF MISTAKES [SECTION 154]
With a view to rectifying any mistakes apparent from the record, an income-tax authority referred to in Section
116 may amend
– any order passed by it under provisions of this Act or
– any intimation or deemed intimation under Section 143(1);
– amend any intimation under sub-section (1) of section 200A;
– amend any intimation under sub-section (1) of section 206CB.
This power of rectification can be exercised by the authorities either on their own motion or at the instance of the
assessee.

Mistake which can be rectified
The mistake sought to be rectified may be a mistake of fact or of law. But the mistake must be one which is
glaring, obvious or apparent from the records and should not be one to discover which a long drawn process of
reasoning, arguments, etc., are needed, or for which there may be conceivably two opinions. A decision on
debatable point of law is not a mistake apparent from the record [T. S. Balram v. Volkart Bros. (1971) 82 ITR p.
50 (S.C.)]. However, ‘the record’ contemplated under Section 154 does not mean only the order of assessment
but it comprises all proceedings on which the assessment order is based. The relevant authority is entitled to
look into the whole evidence and the law applicable to ascertain whether there was an error [Moharana Mills
Pvt. Ltd. v. ITO (1959) 36 ITR p. 350 (S.C.)].
The power of rectification of mistake lies with the authority who passed the order which is sought to be rectified.

Lesson 11

Procedure for Assessment 547

For instance, the Assessing Officer may amend any order of assessment or refund or any other order passed by
him. Likewise, the Deputy Commissioner or Commissioner (Appeals) or the Chief Commissioner or Commissioner
may rectify any order passed by him.
Where an order of rectification of assessment has the effect of enhancing the amount of income assessed or
reducing a refund granted to the assessee or in any way otherwise increasing the liability of the assessee, the
order of rectification can be passed only after giving the assessee a notice in advance and, that too, after giving
him a reasonable opportunity of being heard.
Every order of rectification of assessment must be passed by the authority concerned in writing and should
specifically state how and in what respects the assessment had been rectified. Where any amendment has the
effect of enhancing the assessment or reducing the refund already made, the Assessing Officer shall serve on
the assessee a notice of demand in the prescribed manner specifying the amount of tax, interest or other sum
payable by him.

Time limit
The time limit for rectification of mistakes is a period of four years from the end of the financial year in which the
order sought to be amended was passed.
where an application for an amendment under this section is made by the assessee on or after the 1st day of
June, 2001 to an Income-tax authority referred to in Sub-section (1), the authority shall pass an order, within a
period of six months from the end of the month in which the application is received by it:
– by making the amendment; or
– refusing to allow the claim.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR AUTOMATION OF VARIOUS PROCESSES AND PAPERLESS
ASSESSMENT
Section 282A(1) of the Act has been amended to provide that notices and documents required to be issued by
income-tax authority under the Act shall be issued by such authority either in paper form or in electronic form in
accordance with such procedure as may be prescribed (w.e.f. 1st June, 2016).

LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK TO ENABLE AND EXPAND THE SCOPE OF ELECTRONIC
PROCESSING OF INFORMATION
In order to expeditiously remove the mismatch between the return and the information available with the
Department, it is provided to expand the scope of adjustments that can be made at the time of processing of
returns under sub-section (1) of section 143. It is provided that such adjustments can be made based on the
data available with the Department in the form of audit report filed by the assessee, returns of earlier years of the
assessee, 26AS statement, Form 16, and Form 16A. However, before making any such adjustments, in the
interest of natural justice, intimation shall be given to the assessee either in writing or through electronic mode
requiring him to respond to such adjustments. The response received, if any, will be duly considered before
making any adjustment. However, if no response is received within thirty days of issue of such intimation, the
processing shall be carried out incorporating the adjustments.

ASSUMPTION OF JURISDICTION OF ASSESSING OFFICER
The existing sub-section (3) of the section 124, inter-alia, provides that no person shall be entitled to call in
question the jurisdiction of an Assessing Officer in a case where return is filed under section 139, after the expiry
of one month from the date on which he was served with a notice issued under sub-section (1) of section 142 or
sub-section (2) of section 143 or after the completion of the assessment, whichever is earlier. Currently, this

548 EP-TL&P
provision does not specifically refer to notices issued under section 153A or section 153C which relate to
assessment in cases where a search and seizure action has been taken or cases connected to such cases.
Instances have come to notice wherein the jurisdiction of an Assessing Officer in such cases have been called
into question at the appellate stages, despite the fact that order passed under section 153A or 153C is read with
section 143(3) of the Act. In order to remove any ambiguity in such cases, sub-section (3) of section 124 of the
Act has been amended to specifically provide that cases where search is initiated under section 132 or books of
accounts, other documents or any assets are requisitioned under section 132A, no person shall be entitled to
call into question the jurisdiction of an Assessing Officer after the expiry of one month from the date on which he
was served with a notice under sub-section (1) of section 153A or sub-section (2) of section 153C or after the
completion of the assessment, whichever is earlier (w.e.f. 1st June, 2016).

LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK TO ENABLE AND EXPAND THE SCOPE OF ELECTRONIC
PROCESSING OF INFORMATION
The existing provisions of section 133C empower the prescribed income-tax authority to issue notice calling for
information and documents for the purpose of verification of information in its possession.
In order to expedite verification and analysis of the information and documents so received, Section 133C of the
Act has been amended to provide adequate legislative backing for processing of information and documents so
obtained and making the outcome thereof available to the Assessing Officer for necessary action, if any.
Further, Explanation 2 to section 147 has also been amended to provide for reopening of cases by the AO on the
basis of the information so received.
Clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 143 provides that, a return filed is to be processed and total income or
loss is to be computed after making the adjustments on account of any arithmetical error in the return or on
account of an incorrect claim, if such incorrect claim is apparent from any information in the return.
In order to expeditiously remove the mismatch between the return and the information available with the
Department, the scope of adjustments has been expanded that can be made at the time of processing of returns
under sub-section (1) of section 143. It is provided that such adjustments can be made based on the data
available with the Department in the form of audit report filed by the assessee, returns of earlier years of the
assessee, 26AS statement, Form 16, and Form 16A. However, before making any such adjustments, in the
interest of natural justice, an intimation shall be given to the assessee either in writing or through electronic
mode requiring him to respond to such adjustments. The response received, if any, will be duly considered
before making any adjustment. However, if no response is received within thirty days of issue of such intimation,
the processing shall be carried out incorporating the adjustments.
This amendments effective from the 1st day of June, 2016.

LESSON ROUND UP
– The provisions of the Income-tax Act contained in Sections 117 to 136 specify the procedure relating
to the appointment of the various income-tax authorities, their powers, functions, jurisdiction and
control.
– Income-tax authorities are required to exercise or perform such powers or functions as are assigned
to them by the Board [Section 120(1)].
– Filing of Return: The procedure under the Income-tax Act for making an assessment of income
begins with the filing of a return of income. Section 139 of the Act contains the relevant provisions
relating to the furnishing of a return of income.

Lesson 11

Procedure for Assessment 549

– E-Filing of Return: The Income Tax Department has introduced on line facility in addition to conventional
method to file return of income. The process of electronically filing of Income Tax return through the
mode of internet access is called e-filing of return.
– Permanent Account Number: Every person, who has not been allotted any permanent account
number, is obliged to obtain permanent account number, if;
– if his total income assessable during the previous year exceeds the maximum amount which is
not chargeable to tax or
– any person carrying on business or profession whose total sales turnover or gross receipts are or
is likely to exceed `5,00,000 in any previous year or
– is required to furnish a return of income under Section 139.
– Types Of Assessment
– Self assessment (Section 140A)
– Regular assessment (Section 143)
– Best judgment assessment (Section 144)
– Income escaping assessment or re-assessment (Section 147)
– Precautionary assessment.
– Self assessment is the first step in the process of assessments. Self Assessment is simply a process
where a person himself assesses his tax liability on the income earned during the particular previous
year and submits Income Tax Return to the department.
– Under summary assessment, Assessing Officer completes the assessment without passing a regular
assessment order. The Assessing Officer issue an acknowledgement/intimation under section 143(1)
of tax payable or refundable as the case may be on the basis of Return of Income filed by the assessee
under section 139 or in response to a notice issued under section 142(1).
– Where a return has been made under Section 139, or in response to a notice under Sub-section (1) of
Section 142, the Assessing Officer shall, if he considers necessary or expedient to ensure that the
assessee has not understated the income or has not computed excessive loss or has not underpaid
the tax in any manner, serve on the assessee a notice requiring him, on a date to be specified therein,
either to attend his office or to produce, or cause to be produced there, any evidence on which the
assessee may rely in support of the return.
– Best Judgment Assessment: The Assessing Officer, after taking into account all relevant material
which he has gathered, and after giving the assessee an opportunity of being heard, makes the
assessment of the total income or loss to the best of his judgment and determine the sum payable by
the assessee on the basis of such assessment.
– Income Escaping Assessment: If the Assessing Officer has reason to believe that any income
chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for any assessment year, he may, subject to the provisions
of sections 148 to 153.
– Dispute Resolution Panel: The Assessing Officer shall, forward a draft order of assessment to the
eligible assessee if he proposes to make, on or after the 1st day of October, 2009, any variation in the
income or loss returned which is prejudicial to the interest of such assessee.
– On receipt of the draft order, the eligible assessee shall, within thirty days of the receipt by him of the
draft order.

550 EP-TL&P
– file his acceptance to the Assessing Officer, or
– file his objections with
– the Dispute Resolution Panel; and
– the Assessing Officer
– Rectification of Mistake: With a view to rectifying any mistakes apparent from the record, an incometax authority referred to in Section 116 may amend
– any order passed by it under provisions of this Act or
– any intimation or deemed intimation under Section 143(1).

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

– Introduction

The Income-tax Act provides for various
remedies to an assessee on completion of the
assessment. The main remedies available to
an assessee on completion of the assessment
are Appeals, Revision, and Rectification, all
these remedies work in different areas.
However, strictly speaking the remedies are not
alternative to each other but at times more than
one remedial proceeding may be used as
complimentary to each other so as to achieve
the best results.

– Appeal Before the Commissioner (Appeals)
– Appealable order [Section 246A]
– Procedure for filing of appeal [Section 249(1)]
– Period of limitation to prefer an appeal
[Section 249(2)]
– Payment of Tax before Filing Appeal
[Section 249(4)]
– Procedure in appeal (Section 250)
– Powers of the Commissioner (Appeals)
– Revision by the Commissioner of Income Tax
(Section 263 and 264)

The right to appeal arises where the taxpayer is
aggrieved by the order passed by the income-tax
authority. Where the Assessing Officer accepts the
return filed by the tax payer and passes an order
making no modification, an appeal does not lie
against that order as the taxpayer cannot be said
to be aggrieved of that order.

– Revision of orders prejudicial to the interest
of revenue (Section 263)

INTRODUCTION
The right to appeal must be given by express enactment in the Act. Therefore, in case there is no provision in the
Act for filing an appeal regarding a particular matter, no appeal shall lie. The right to appeal arises where the
taxpayer is aggrieved by the order passed by the income-tax authority. However, where the Assessing Officer
accepts the return filed by the tax payer and passes an order making no modification, an appeal does not lie
against that order as the taxpayer cannot be said to be aggrieved of that order. Similarly, where an appellate
authority accepts the contention of the taxpayer and allows the appeal, there is no further appeal by the assessee
against that order.
The assessee may prefer an appeal against the orders of the Assessing Officer to the Commissioner (Appeals),
in accordance with the relevant provisions under Section 246 and appeal against the order of the Commissioner
(Appeals) can be preferred by the Assessee or the Commissioner of Income Tax and such appeal lies with the
Appellate Tribunal.
The Finance (No.2) Act, 1998 has amended the provisions regarding remedy against order of Tribunal. Where
earlier the assessee or the CIT, if not satisfied with the order of Tribunal, could only request the Tribunal to refer
that matter to the High Court. After 1.10.98 as provided by Finance (No.2) Act, 1998 the assessee or CIT if not
satisfied with the order of the tribunal can appeal directly to the High Court, if High Court is satisfied that the case
involve a substantial question of law and if the assessee or Commissioner of Income-tax is not satisfied with the
order passed by the High Court they may file an appeal against the order of the High Court to the Supreme
Court. However, it should be noted that in the case of question of fact tribunal is the final & binding authority and
its decision is final.

APPEALS ORDERS BEFORE COMMISSIONER (APPEALS)
Appealable order before Commissioner (Appeals) (Section 246A)

Where a person has deducted and paid tax in accordance with Section 195 and 200 in respect of any sum (other
than interest) chargeable under the Act he is entitled to prefer an appeal under Section 248 to be declared not
liable to deduct tax. In other words, the right to appeal under Section 248 is conditional and can be exercised
only if tax is deducted at source and paid to the Government.
Section 248 provides that where under an agreement or other arrangement, the tax deductible on any income
(not being interest) under Section 195 is to be borne by the payer (i.e., “net of tax” arrangement) and such
person having paid such tax to the credit of the Central Government, claims that no tax was required to be
deducted on such income, he may appeal to the Commissioner (Appeals) for a declaration that no tax was
deductible on such income.

PROCEDURE FOR FILING OF APPEAL [SECTION 249(1)]
The appeal should be filed in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner. In case of an appeal
made to the Commissioner (Appeals) on or after the 1st day of October, 1998, it shall be accompanied by a fees
irrespective of the date of initiation of the assessment proceedings. The rates of fees are as follows:
– `250 when the assessed income is one hundred thousand rupees or less (income/loss) compute.
– ` 500 when the assessed income is more than one hundred thousand rupees but not more than two
hundred thousand rupees.

556 EP-TL&P
– `1000 when the assessed income is more than two hundred thousand rupees.
– `250 in any other case.
Form No. 35 is the prescribed form [under Rule 45(1)] of the appeal. The form of appeal, the grounds and the
verification appended to the form should be signed [Rule 45(2)] as per provisions applicable to the signing of
return under Section 140.
Form No.35 requires that the memorandum of appeal, statement of facts and the grounds of the appeal must be
in duplicate and should be accompanied by a copy of the order appealed against and the notice of demand in
original, if any.

PERIOD OF LIMITATION TO PREFER AN APPEAL [SECTION 249(2)]
The appeal has to be presented within the period of limitation as given below:
1. Appeal by person denying liability to deduct tax in respect of payments payable to non-resident or a
foreign company [Section 249(2)(a)] : Where the appeal relates to any tax deducted at source from payment
made to a non-resident, (other than a company) or to a foreign company, any interest, other ‘than interest
on securities or any other sum chargeable under the provisions of the Income Tax Act (not being salaries),
within 30 days from the date of payment of tax deducted at source to the credit of the Central Government.
2. Appeal against assessment to penalty [Section 249(2)(b)] : Where the appeal relates to any assessment
or penalty order the appeals have to be presented within 30 days of the date of service of the notice of
demand relating to that assessment or penalty order.
3. Other appeals [Section 249(2)(c)] : In any other case, the appeal has to be presented within 30 days of
the date on which intimation of the order sought to be appealed against is served on the appellant.
In computing the period of limitation for an appeal or an application, the day on which the order is served has to
be excluded. If the assessee was not furnished with a copy of the order along with the notice of the order, or
demand, the time required for obtaining a copy of such order is also to be excluded and the date will be extended
by that period. It may be noted that even where the assessee has not been supplied with copy of the order
concerned, the time taken in making an application which does not comply with all the legal requirements
cannot be excluded under the provisions of Section 268. If the application for obtaining the copy of the order has
not been properly stamped or has been made by a person not authorised to do so, the time which has elapsed
between the making of the invalid application and putting the application in order would not be excluded in
computing the period of limitation.
If any appeal is filed after the period of limitation, the Commissioner (Appeals) may admit the appeal after the said
period if he is satisfied that the appellant had sufficient cause for not presenting the appeal within that period
[Section 249(3)]. Such delayed appeals must be accompanied by a condonation petition showing and explaining
the reason/cause of the appellant for not being able to file the appeal within the period of limitation and praying for
condemnation of the delay. The power to condone the delay is discretionary and the discretion must be judiciously
exercised. The discretion is to be exercised where sufficient cause for not presenting the appeal within the time is
made out by the appellant. The period for filing an appeal cannot be extended simply because the appellant’s case
is hard and calls for sympathy or merely out of benevolence to the party seeking relief. The sufficient cause must
be a cause which is beyond the control of the party seeking the condonation of the delay. Illness is sufficient cause,
if it can be shown that the man was utterly disabled to attend to any duty. The cause for delay in filing the appeal
which, by due care and attention could have been avoided cannot be a sufficient cause. Negligence on the part of
the servants or agent entrusted with the filing of the appeal cannot be considered as a sufficient cause. The
change of legal situation brought about by a decision of the Supreme Court may be valid ground for condoning
delay. The words “sufficient cause” should receive a liberal interpretation so as to advance substantial justice
where no negligence nor inaction nor want of bona fide is imputable to the applicant.
An appeal presented after the period of limitation is still an “appeal” and an order dismissing it as time barred is

Lesson 12

Appeals, Revisions, Settlement of Cases and Penalties & Offences

557

one passed in appeal [under Section 250 and not under Section 249(3)]. An appeal lies therefrom to the Appellate
Tribunal and thereafter to the High Court on a question of law.
Provided further that where an application has been made under sub-section (1) of section 270AA, the period
beginning from the date on which the application is made, to the date on which the order rejecting the application
is served on the assessee, shall be excluded [Inserted vide Finance Act, 2016].

PAYMENT OF TAX BEFORE FILING APPEAL [SECTION 249(4)]
No appeal against any order passed by the Assessing Officer can be admitted by the Commissioner (Appeals)
unless at the time of filing of the appeal the assessee has paid tax due on the income returned by him, and
where the assessee has not furnished the return of income, he has paid an amount equal to the amount of
advance tax which was payable by him. If the appellant wants exemption from the payment of such tax he has
to make an application to the Commissioner (Appeals) who is empowered to waive this requirement in appropriate
cases if he is satisfied that there are good and sufficient reasons for doing so. In such cases, the Commissioner
(Appeals) is required to record such reasons in writing. It may be noted that Income-tax law requires only the
payment of tax before the filing of the appeal and not the payment of any penalty or any other sum payable by
the assessee on the basis of the order appealed against.

PROCEDURE IN APPEAL (SECTION 250)
Commissioner (Appeals) shall fix a day and place for the hearing of the appeal and shall give notice of the same
to the appellant and to the Assessing Officer against whose order the appeal is preferred.
The following shall have the right to be heard at the hearing of the appeal:
(a) The appellant, either in person or by an authorised representative.
(b) The Assessing Officer, either in person or by a representative.
The Commissioner (Appeals) shall have the power to adjourn the hearing of the appeals from time to time. He
may, before disposing of any appeal, make such further enquiry as he deems fit, or may direct the Assessing
Officer to make further enquiry and report as he deems fit, or may direct the Assessing Officer to make further
enquiry and report the result of the same to the Commissioner (Appeals).
The Commissioner (Appeals) may, at the hearing of an appeal, allow the appellant to go into any ground of
appeal not specified in the grounds of appeal if he is satisfied that the omission of that ground from the form of
appeal was not willful or unreasonable. His order disposing of the appeal shall be in writing and shall state the
points for determination, the decision thereon and the reasons for the decision. In every appeal, the Commissioner
(Appeal), where it is possible, may hear and decide such appeal within a period of one year from the end of the
financial year in which such appeal is filed before him Commissioner (Appeal) under Section 246A(1). On the
disposal of the appeal, the Commissioner (Appeals) shall communicate the order passed by him to the assessee
and to the Chief Commissioner or Commissioner.

POWERS OF THE COMMISSIONER (APPEALS) (SECTION 251)
In disposing of an appeal, the Commissioner (Appeals) shall have the following powers:
1. In an appeal against an order of assessment, he may confirm, reduce, enhance or annul the assessment.
2. In an appeal against an order imposing a penalty, he may confirm or cancel such order or vary it so as
to either enhance or reduce the penalty.
3. In any other case, he may pass such orders in the appeal as he deems fit.
The Commissioner (Appeals) shall not enhance an assessment or a penalty or reduce the amount of refund
unless the appellant has had a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against such enhancement or reduction.
While disposing an appeal, the Commissioner (Appeals) may consider and decide the facts arising out of the

558 EP-TL&P
proceedings which in respect of order appealed against were carried notwithstanding that such matter was not
raised before the Commissioner (Appeals) by the appellant.
In an appeal against the order of assessment in respect of which the proceedings before the Settlement
Commission abates under the section 245HA, the Commissioner (appeals) can confirm, reduce, enhance or
annul the assessment after taking into consideration of the following –
1. the material and other information produced by the assessee before the Settlement Commission
2. the results of the enquiry held by the Settlement Commission
3. the evidence recorded by the Settlement commission in the course of proceedings before it
4. such other material as may be brought on his record.

REVISION BY THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX (SECTIONS 263 AND 264)
The right to file such appeals against the orders of the Assessing Officer is not available to the Department. It is
for this reason that the Commissioner has been vested with revisional powers under Section 263, where the
order of the Assessing Officer is erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interests of the revenue. But such
revisional power can be exercised only in respect of orders which are not the subject matter of appeals. The
reason is that once an assessment order is appealed against, the Commissioner (Appeals) has got the powers
to enhance the assessment under Section 263 and a right of appeal upto the Tribunal is provided to the assessee
against the orders of the Assessing Officer. In the following cases Commissioner of Income-tax can revise an
order passed by the Assessing Officer:

REVISION OF ORDERS PREJUDICIAL TO THE INTEREST OF REVENUE (SECTION 263)
The Department has no right of appeal to the Commissioner (Appeals) against any order passed by the Assessing
Officer. Therefore, the Commissioner of Income-tax has been empowered to revise such orders of the Assessing
Officer as are prejudicial to the interest of the revenue. Such power, however, is subject to certain conditions as
given below :
1. Revision can be only of the order of Assessing Officer [Section 263(1)]
The Commissioner of Income-tax can revise only the orders of Assessing Officer. For the purposes of this clause,
an order passed by the Assessing Officer includes an order of assessment passed on or before or after 1.6.1988,
including: (i) an assessment order made by the Assistant Commissioner or the Income Tax Officer on the basis of
the directions issued by the Joint Commissioner under Section 144A, (ii) an order made by the Joint Commissioner
in exercise of the powers or in performance of the functions of an Assessing Officer conferred on, or assigned to
him under the orders or directions issued by the Board or by the Chief Commissioner or Director General or
Commissioner authorised by the Board in this behalf under Section 120 [Jurisdiction of Income Tax authorities].
An explanation to the above sub section has been inserted by Finance Act, 2015, w.e.f 1.6.15 that an order
passed by the Assessing Officer shall be deemed to be erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interests of
the revenue, if, in the opinion of the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner,—
(a) the order is passed without making inquiries or verification which should have been made;
(b) the order is passed allowing any relief without inquiring into the claim;
(c) the order has not been made in accordance with any order, direction or instruction issued by the Board
under section 119; or
(d) the order has not been passed in accordance with any decision which is prejudicial to the assessee, rendered
by the jurisdictional High Court or Supreme Court in the case of the assessee or any other person.”.
In case the order referred to above has been the subject matter of any appeal filed on or before or after June1,
1988 the powers of the Commissioner shall extend and shall always be deemed to have extended to such

Lesson 12

Appeals, Revisions, Settlement of Cases and Penalties & Offences

559

matters as had not been considered and decided in such appeal. The appellate orders passed by the
Commissioner (Appeals) are outside the purview of the revisional powers vested in the Commissioner of Incometax. But if the assessment order of the Assessing Officer is pending in an appeal before the appellate authority
(as aforesaid), it can be revised by the Commissioner of Income-tax. So long the appeal is not disposed of, the
order of the Assessing Officer will be considered as subsisting and operative. Therefore, it can be revised.
2. Order erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of revenue [Section 263(1)]
If the Commissioner of Income-tax considers that the order of the Assessing Officer is erroneous in so far as it
is prejudicial to the interest of the revenue, such order can be revised after giving the assessee an opportunity
of being heard.
The word “erroneous” includes cases where there has been a failure to make the necessary enquiries. The
Commissioner of Income-tax may consider an order of the Assessing Officer to be erroneous not only if it contains
some apparent error of reasoning or of law or of fact on the face of it but also because it is a stereotype order which
simply accepts what the assessee has stated in his return and fails to make enquiries which are called for in the
circumstances of the case. The Assessing Officer is not only an adjudicator but also an investigator. He cannot
remain passive in the face of a return which is apparently in order but calls for further enquiry. It is his duty to
ascertain the truth of the facts stated in return when the circumstances of the case are such as to provoke enquiry.
The words “prejudicial to the interests of revenue” appearing under Section 263(1) have not been defined in the
Act, but they must mean that the order of the Assessing Officer is such, that it is not in accordance with law in
consequence whereof the lawful revenue due to the State has not been realised or cannot be realised. The
Allahabad High Courts’ decision in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Sunder Lal (1974, 96 ITR 310) was followed
by it in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Kashi Nath & Co. 1988, 170 ITR 28) holding that the power of the
Commissioner of income-tax under Section 263 of the Income Tax Act is quasi-judicial in character. He must
give reasons in support of his conclusion that the assessment order is erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to
the interests of the Revenue. If he does not give the reasons, the order can be vitiated. For example, if the
Commissioner is of the opinion that the Assessing Officer had allowed deductions in excess of what they were
due in a particular case, such order is erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue. Hence, it may be
revised by the Commissioner of Income Tax.
In Malabar Industrial Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner Income Tax (1992,198 ITR 611) the Kerala High Court held that
the words ‘prejudicial to the interests of the revenue’ are of wide import and they should not be limited to a case
where the order passed by the Income-tax Officer (now Assessing Officer) can be considered to be one prejudicial
to the revenue administration as such. The question whether an order of the Income Tax Officer is prejudicial to
the interests of revenue would depend on the facts of each case and there can be no universal formula applicable
to finding out any such prejudicial error. The High Court followed the rule laid down by the Supreme Court in Tara
Devi Aggarwal v. CIT (1973, 88 ITR 523) but dissented from the rule laid down by the Madras High Court in
Venkatakrishna Rice Co. v. CIT (1987, 163 ITR 129).
The Commissioner can revise an order passed by the Assessing Officer only if it is erroneous and prejudicial to
the interests of the revenue; if the order sought to be revised is not prejudicial to the interest of the revenue the
Commissioner has no jurisdiction to revise it. The failure of the Assessing Officer to deal with the claim of the
assessee in the assessment order may be an error, but an erroneous order by itself is not enough to give
jurisdiction to the Commissioner to revise it under Section 263. It must be further shown that the order was
prejudicial to the interests of the revenue.
3. Assessee to be given an opportunity of being heard [Section 263(1)]
The process of revision is completed in three stages: (i) the Commissioner may call for and examine the records
of any proceeding under the Act which is within his administrative powers. If after examining the material and
relevant facts on record, the Commissioner considers prima facie that any order of the Assessing Officer is
erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of the revenue, he must, in the (ii) place, give the assessee an opportunity

560 EP-TL&P
of being heard. The opportunity of being heard to be given to the assessee contemplates that the Commissioner
must disclose to the assessee the grounds on which he desires to make a revision under Section 263. This is
essential. If the assessee does not know on what points he is to be heard, he may not visualise what he has to
say at the hearing and the opportunity of being heard may prove to be illusory. Further, the notice to show cause
must be served on the assessee reasonably ahead of the date fixed for hearing, because the time allowed to the
assessee to prepare the case should not be short but reasonable. The Commissioner is also required to examine
the merits of the objection raised by the assessee. Without going into the merits of the claim of the assessee, it
is not possible for the Commissioner to say that the order of the Assessing Officer has caused any prejudice to
the interests of the revenue. He may also cause enquiry to be made by his subordinates. Before making his
order, he must disclose to the assessee the material collected by him on enquiry if he wants to use the materials
collected from such inquiry against the assessee. If the matter collected from the enquiry is only supporting
material and does not constitute the basic grounds on which the revision order is to be passed, the failure of the
Commissioner to disclose to the assessee the fact of the enquiry does not vitiate the revision order.
In the third stage, the Commissioner is required to pass the necessary order if he finally concludes that the order
of the Assessing Officer is erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue. He can enhance or modify
the assessment. He has also the power to cancel the assessment and direct a fresh assessment. The power of
cancellation of the assessment with a direction to make a fresh assessment is called for only in cases where
there is something totally or basically is wrong with the assessment which is not capable of being remedied by
amendments to the assessment order itself. Where the Commissioner comes to the conclusion that there is a
defect in the assessment order in so far as the question of the levy of interest was not considered by the
Assessing Officer, the Commissioner should direct the Assessing Officer to consider the question on merits and
in accordance with law after giving the assessee an opportunity of being heard. It is not further necessary for
him, nor would the circumstances of the case justify, that the whole assessment should be set aside. Setting
aside the assessment has got far reaching consequences and such power should be exercised only where the
circumstances call for a remedial action. The revisional order must be a speaking order giving reasons for such
revisions otherwise the order may be vitiated. The power of suo-moto revision of the Commissioner of Incometax under Section 263(1) is in the nature of supervisory jurisdiction and can be exercised only if the circumstances
specified therein exist. Two circumstances must exist: (i) the order should be erroneous, and (ii) by virtue of the
order being erroneous, prejudice must have been caused to the interests of the revenue. An order cannot be
termed as erroneous unless it is not in accordance with law. If an Income-tax Officer acting in accordance with
law makes certain assessment, the same cannot be termed as erroneous by the Commissioner simply because
according to him, the order should have been written more elaborately. In this case, the Tribunal was held
justified in setting aside the order passed by the Commissioner under Section 263.
4. Time limit for making the revisional order [Sections 263(2) and (3)]
The revisional order can be passed within two years from the end of the financial year in which the order sought to be
revised was passed [Section 263(2)]. Once the revisional order is made within the time limit of two years from the end
of the relevant financial year it is a valid order even if it is served on the assessee after the expiry of two years.
In computing the time limit of two years, the time taken in giving an opportunity to the assessee to be reheard
(under Section 129) and any period during which the proceeding (under Section 263) is stayed by an order or
injunction of any court is excluded [Explanation to Section 263(2)]. Order under Section 263 can't be passed to
reduce tax utility or in favour of assessee. However Appeal against Section 263 can be made to ITAT.
It may be noted that the limit of two years does not apply to a revisional order which had been passed in
consequences of or to give effect to, any finding or direction contained in an order of the Appellate Tribunal, the
High Court or the Supreme Court. Such revisional order may be passed at any time [Section 263(3)].

REVISION OF ORDER IN THE INTEREST OF ASSESSEE (SECTION 264)
An aggrieved assessee has his normal right of appeal against the order of the Assessing Officer to Commissioner

Lesson 12

Appeals, Revisions, Settlement of Cases and Penalties & Offences

561

(Appeals) under Section 246A and thereafter to the Appellate Tribunal under Section 253. Further, each and
every order of the Assessing Officer is not appealable to the appellate authorities under Sections 246A and 253.
The assessee may seek justice in such cases by making an application under section 264 to the Commissioner
of Income Tax. For example, revision lies to the Commissioner against the levy of penal interest for not furnishing
the return of total income within the prescribed time against which no appeal has been provided.
The revisional order passed under Section 264 cannot be prejudicial to the interest of the assessee. The whole
subject matter is discussed below –
1. Revision of order of subordinate authority only [Section 264(1) and Explanation 2]
The Principal Commissioner or Commissioner of Income Tax may revise any order of an authority subordinate
to him. Deputy Commissioner, Income Tax Officers and Inspectors of Income Tax are subordinate to the Principal
Commissioner or Commissioner according to Section 118.
2. Suo motu revision [Section 264(1) and (2)]
The Principal Commissioner or Commissioner may, suo motu call for the record of any proceeding under this
Act in which any, order has been passed by any authority subordinate to him. He may make such enquiry and
may pass such order as he thinks fit but such order cannot be prejudicial to the assessee [Section 264(1)]. He
may act in such circumstances without notice to the assessee and without giving him an opportunity of being
heard. Such exercise of the authority is a purely departmental affair and the assessee may know nothing about
this. While acting suo motu, the Commissioner may revise the order of his subordinate authority within one year
from the date of the order sought to be revised [Section 264(2)]. If the order has been made more than one year
back, such order cannot be revised by him.
It is obligatory on the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner to pass an order under Section 264 within a
period of one year from the end of financial year in which the application is made for revision. In computing the
period of limitation, the time taken in giving an opportunity to the assessee to be re-heard (under Section 129)
and any period during which any proceeding under this Section is stayed by an order or injunction of any court
is excluded. Though an order has, to be passed within one year, an order in revision may be passed at any time
in consequence of or to give effect to any findings or directions contained in an order of the Appellate Tribunal,
High Court or the Supreme Court.
3. Revision on application of the assessee [Section 264(1), (3) & (5)]
The assessee is entitled to make an application to the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner of Income-tax
for the revision of any order passed by an authority subordinate to him. Such an application can be made within
one year from the date on which the order in question was communicated to him or from the date on which he
otherwise came to know of it, whichever is earlier [Section 264(3)]. The Principal Commissioner or Commissioner
is empowered to admit a belated application if he is satisfied that the assessee was prevented by sufficient
cause from making the application within the prescribed time.
The application for revision by the assessee is always to be accompanied by a fee of `500 [Section 264(5)]. On
receipt of the revision application, the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner may call for the record. He may
make such enquiry and pass such order as he deems fit. Such an order should not be prejudicial to the assessee
[Section 264(1)].
There are two important points of distinction between the cases: (i) where the Principal Commissioner or
Commissioner makes suo motu revision; and (ii) where he makes a revision on the application of the assessee.
While acting suo motu, he can pass the revisional order only within one year from the date of the order sought
to be revised. There is no such time limit when the revisional order is passed on the basis of application filed by
the assessee. Once the application is made within the period of limitation prescribed therefor, or after the
condonation of delay, the order may be passed at any time thereafter. Secondly, while acting suo motu, the

562 EP-TL&P
Commissioner acts in the exercise of his administrative jurisdiction and, hence, he is not bound to give a hearing
to the assessee. In fact the review is purely a departmental affair in such cases. On the other hand, when he is
moved by the assessee for the said purposes, the jurisdiction conferred on him is a judicial one and, hence, he
must give an opportunity to the assessee to put forward his case.
4. Nature of the order under Section 264
The Principal Commissioner or Commissioner may pass such order as he thinks fit provided such order is not
prejudicial to the assessee. This is so whether the Commissioner acts suo motu, or on the revision application
of the assessee. An order of the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner passed in revision can be said to be
prejudicial to the assessee only when he is, as a result of it, placed in a different and worse position than that in
which he was placed by the order under review’. If the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner effects a
reduction of income under one head and an increase under another but, on the whole reduces the assessment,
his order cannot be said to be prejudicial to the assessee. Though the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner
may not change the order of the subordinate authority to the prejudice of the assessee, he may not give the
relief asked for by the assessee. An order of the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner declining to interfere
with the order of the subordinate authority cannot be deemed to be an order prejudicial to the assessee
(Explanation 1 to Section 264). The power to pass such orders as he deems fit is not an arbitrary one to be
exercised according to his fancy. He must act according to the rules of reason and justice, not according to
private opinion, according to law not humor. His discretion is not to be arbitrary, vague and fanciful, but legal and
regular. It is a power coupled with duty to exercise it in the interest of justice to the assessee.

CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH NO REVISION CAN BE MADE [SECTION 264(4)]
The Principal Commissioner or Commissioner of Income-tax cannot revise the order of his subordinate authority
in the following cases:
(i) If the order is appealable to the Commissioner (Appeals), such order cannot be revised until the time within
which such appeal may be made expires. If an appeal has been made to the Commissioner (Appeals), the
revisional power cannot be exercised while the appeal is pending but it may be exercised after the appeal
has been disposed of. The Commissioner (Appeals) for the purpose of Section 264 is an authority subordinate
to the Commissioner of Income-tax. Hence, the order of the Commissioner (Appeals) can be revised.
(ii) If the order is appealable to the Commissioner (Appeals) or the Appellate Tribunal, revisional power
cannot be exercised until the time within which such appeal may be made expires. But, in such cases,
if the assessee waives his right of appeal, the Commissioner may revise the order even before the time
for appeal has expired. But once the order has been made the subject of an appeal the revisional
powers come to an end. An order can be said to be made the “subject of an appeal” only when it is the
subject of an effective appeal. If the Commissioner (Appeals) or the Appellate Tribunal refuses to entertain
an appeal on the ground that it is time barred, or grants permission to the appellant to withdraw the
appeal, the order cannot be said to be the “subject of an appeal” and the assessee would be entitled to
apply to the Commissioner for revision.

REMEDY AGAINST THE REVISIONAL ORDER
An order of the Commissioner passed under Section 264 is not appealable to the Tribunal. Nor does a reference
lie against such an order to the High Court since a reference to the High Court lies only against an order passed
by the Tribunal. Since the order of the Commissioner is judicial or quasi-judicial in character, it is within the ambit
of the High Court’s jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution and a petition for a writ of certiorari to quash
an unjust or illegal order of the Commissioner is maintainable.

APPELLATE TRIBUNAL (SECTION 252)
The Central Government shall constitute an Appellate Tribunal consisting of as many judicial and accountant

Lesson 12

Appeals, Revisions, Settlement of Cases and Penalties & Offences

563

members as it thinks fit to exercise the powers and discharge the functions conferred on the Appellate Tribunal
by this Act. The ITAT is constituted and works under the Ministry of Law. It is thus a body outside the administrative
control of the Central Board of Direct Taxes.
The Appellate Tribunal is not an Income-tax Authority in the sense of being an integral part of the department. On
the contrary, by its constitution, powers and jurisdiction, not to speak of the manner of their recruitment, the
Tribunal is an independent arbitral tribunal. The proceedings before it are advisory. It has also the trappings of a
judicial body in the sense that it has to deal with the Department on the one side, and the assessee on the other
in as much as they face each other as opposing parties. In such a situation the Tribunal has to decide only those
issues which are properly raised before it by the one or the other party in the appeal or in the cross objections.
Under the Act, the Tribunal has got to decide an appeal and not merely give it a disposal by dismissing it for
default of appearance. This, however, does not mean that the Tribunal has got to take upon themselves the
responsibility of finding facts or points of law which are not urged by the Department or the assessee, as the
case may be. CIT v. A. C. Paul (1983) 142 ITA 811 (Mad.).
The Tribunal is the final Authority and ordinarily, if after considering the matters in the proper perspective and
after surveying all material which is available to it, the Tribunal arrives at some conclusion one way or the other,
that conclusion would have to be respected, unless it can be regarded as impossible or perverse. CIT v. Lalchand
Bhabutmal Jain (1985) 151 ITR 360 (Bom.).

APPEALABLE ORDERS [SECTION 253(1) AND (2)]
Any assessee aggrieved by any of the following orders may appeal to the Appellate Tribunal against such order.
1. An order passed by Commissioner (Appeals) under Section 154 ordering a rectification of mistake, or
under Section 250 in connection with the disposal of an appeal or Section 271 imposing a penalty for
failure to furnish return etc. or section 270A [inserted vide Finance Act, 2016] or Sections 271 A or
272A.
2. An order passed by an assessing officer under Clause (c) of Section 158BC, in respect of search
initiated under Section 132 or books of account other documents or any assets requisitioned under
Section 132A, after the 30th day of June, 1995 but before the 1st day of January, 1997.
3. An order passed by a Principal Commissioner or Commissioner under Section 12AA relating to
registration of trust or under Section 263 relating to revision of orders prejudicial to revenue or under
Section 272A penalty for failure to answer question, sign statements, allow inspection etc., on or
under Section 154 rectifying a mistake, or an order passed by a Chief Commissioner, or a Director
General or a director under Section 272A.
4. An order passed by an Assessing Officer under Sub-section (1) of Section 115VZC.
5. An order passed by an Assessing Officer under section 143(3) or section 147 or section 153A or section
153C with the approval of the commissioner or an order passed under section 154 or section 155.
6. An order passed by an Assessing Officer under section 143(3) or section 147 or section 153A or section
153C with the approval of the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner as referred to section 144BA
(12) or an order passed under section 154 or section 155 in respect of such order;
7. An order passed by the prescribed authority under sub-clause (vi) or sub-clause (via) of clause (23C) of
section 10.
The Commissioner may, if he objects to any order passed by Commissioner (Appeals) under Section 154 or
250, direct the Assessing Officer to appeal to the Appellate Tribunal against the order.

PROCEDURE FOR FILING APPEAL [SECTION 253(3), (4)&(6)]
Every appeal to the Appellate Tribunal shall be filed within sixty days of the date on which the, order sought to be
appealed against is communicated to the assessee or to the Commissioner, as the case may be.

564 EP-TL&P
The Assessing Officer or the assessee, as the case may be, on receipt of notice that an appeal against the order
of the Commissioner (Appeals) has been preferred by the other party may, notwithstanding that he may not
have appealed against such order or any part thereof, within thirty days of the receipt of notice, file a memorandum
of cross-objections, verified in the prescribed manner, against any part of the order of the Commissioner (Appeals)
and such memorandum shall be disposed of by the Appellate Tribunal as if it were an appeal presented within
the specified period.
The Appellate Tribunal may admit an appeal or permit the filing of a memorandum of cross-objections after the
expiry of the relevant period if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not presenting it within that period.
An appeal to the Appellate Tribunal shall be in the prescribed form and shall be verified in the prescribed manner
and shall, in case of an appeal made on or after the 1st day of October, 1998, irrespective of the date of initiation
of the assessment proceedings be accompanied by a fine of :
(a) ` 500 where the assessed income/loss is 1,00,000 rupees or less.
(b) ` 1,500 where the assessed income/loss is more than one hundred thousand rupees but not more than
two hundred thousand rupees.
(c) One percent of the assessed income, subject to a maximum of ten thousand rupees where the assessed
income is more than two hundred thousand rupees,
(d) ` 500 in any other case, except in case of an appeal filed by the department or a memorandum of crossobjections.
An application for stay of demand has to be accompanied by a fee of ` 500.
In making an appeal to the Tribunal, the following documents shall be sent in triplicate.
(a) The memorandum of appeal.
(b) The grounds of appeal.
(c) Copy of the order of the Commissioner (Appeals).
(d) Copy of the grounds of appeal and statement of facts filed before the Commissioner (Appeals).
(e) Copy of the order of the Assessing Officer.
(f) Challan for payment of requisite fee.
Where the appellant desires to refer to any documents or evidence he is permitted to file the same with Tribunal
in the form of a paper book within one month from the date of filing the appeal. Though the prescribed period in
one month, it will be preferable to file the same along with the appeal. Where an appellate order by the
Commissioner (Appeals) is passed as a consolidated order for a number of years, appeals to the Tribunal shall
be filed separately for each year.

Procedure when in an appeal by revenue an identical question of law is pending before Supreme
Court [Section 158AA]
A new section 158AA is inserted in the Income-Tax Act by Finance Act, 2015 relating to procedure when in an
appeal by revenue on an identical question of law is pending before Supreme Court. Sub-section (1) seeks to
provide that where the Commissioner or Principal Commissioner is of the opinion that any question of law
arising in the case of an assessee for any assessment year is identical with a question of law arising in his case
for another assessment year which is pending before the Supreme Court, he may, instead of directing the
Assessing Officer to file appeal to the Appellate Tribunal, direct the Assessing Officer to make an application to
the Appellate Tribunal, stating that an appeal on the question of law arising in the relevant case may be filed
when the decision on the question of law becomes final in the other case.

Lesson 12

Appeals, Revisions, Settlement of Cases and Penalties & Offences

565

Sub-section (2) seeks to provide that the Commissioner or Principal Commissioner shall direct the Assessing
Officer to make an application under subsection (1) only if an acceptance is received from the assessee to the
effect that the question of law in the other case is identical to that arising in the relevant case; and in case no
such acceptance is received, the Commissioner or Principal Commissioner shall proceed in accordance with
the provisions contained in section 253 (2) or sec 253(2A).
Sub-section (3) seeks to provide that where the order of the Commissioner (Appeals) referred to in sub-section
(1) is not in conformity with the final decision on the question of law in the other case, the Commissioner or
Principal Commissioner may direct the Assessing Officer to appeal to the Appellate Tribunal against such order
and, save as otherwise provided in this section, all other provisions of Part B of chapter XX shall apply accordingly.

ORDER OF APPELLATE TRIBUNAL (SECTION 254)
The Appellate Tribunal may, after giving both the parties to appeal an opportunity of being heard, pass such
orders thereon as it may think fit.
The Appellate Tribunal may, at any time within six months the end of month in which the order was passed
[Amendment vide Finance Act, 2016], with a view to rectifying any mistake apparent from the record, amend any
order passed by it and shall make such amendment if the mistake is brought to its notice by the assessee or the
Assessing Officer. But, any amendment which has the effect of enhancing an assessment or reducing a refund or
otherwise increasing the liability of the assessee shall not be made unless the Appellate Tribunal has given notice
to the assessee of its intention to do so and has allowed the assessee a reasonable opportunity of being heard.
The Tribunal’s decision would have binding effect within the jurisdiction and has a persuasive value outside its
jurisdiction.
Sub-section (2A) provides that in every appeal, the Appellate Tribunal, where it is possible may hear and decide
such appeal within a period of four years from the end of the financial year in which such appeal is filed under
Section 253(1). Sub-section (2B) provides that the cost of any appeal to the Appellate Tribunal shall be at the
discretion of the Tribunal.
Section 254(2A) pertaining to stay of demand by the Appellate Tribunal has been modified as follows:
1. Initially the Tribunal can pass an order of the stay only for a period not exceeding 180 days from the date
of the order staying the demand.
2. The tribunal shall dispose of appeal within the aforesaid period.
3. If appeal is not disposed of within the aforesaid period, the period of stay may be extended. The total
period of stay cannot be more than 365 days reckoned from the beginning of the period. Extension is
possible only if delay is not attributable to assessee.
4. Appeal shall be disposed of by the Tribunal within the extended period.
5. If appeal is not disposed of within the extended period or periods, the order of stay shall stand vacated
after the expiry of such period or periods.
The Appellate Tribunal shall send a copy of any orders passed under this section to the assessee and to the
Commissioner. On question of fact, the order passed by the Appellate Tribunal on appeal shall be final. An order
made by the Appellate Tribunal shall be sufficiently comprehensive and self-contained. It should be possible to
ascertain from the order all the relevant facts and the questions arising on the appeal. It should also disclose
what were the contentions of the parties and should state why and for what reasons those contentions were
repelled.
Under Section 254(1), the Tribunal may, after giving both parties to the appeal an opportunity of being heard,
pass such-orders thereon as it deems fit.

566 EP-TL&P
No limitation has been placed on the powers of the Commissioner (Appeals) or the Appellate Tribunal under
Section 251(1) or 254(1). The only limitation on their appellate jurisdiction is that they cannot go into the question
of propriety of an ex-parte proceeding or a best judgement assessment. The quantum of assessment, the quantum
of tax or the question of registration of a firm can always be gone into. Vishnu Kumar Gupta v. CIT (1983) 143 ITR
169 (All). However, the power of stay is not likely to be exercised in a routine way or as a matter of course in view
of the special nature of taxation and revenue laws. Only when a strong prima facie case is made out, the Tribunal
will consider whether to stay the recovery proceedings. Stay will be granted only in deserving and appropriate
cases and where the Tribunal is satisfied that the entire purpose of the appeal will be frustrated or rendered
nugatory by allowing the recovery proceedings to continue during the dependency of the appeal before it.
Section 254(1) empowers the Appellate Tribunal to give its decision on the grounds urged and it can pass
appropriate orders. It is not open to the Tribunal itself to raise a ground or permit the party who had not appealed
to raise a ground which will work adversely on the appellants.
Under Section 254(2), the Appellate Tribunal has got ample power to rectify a mistake apparent from record suo
motu. If the mistake is brought to the notice of the Tribunal by the parties to the appeal, the Tribunal is empowered
to rectify the same. Addl. CIT v. ITAT (1983) 139 ITR 615 (AP).
From the Assessment year 2009-10(w.e.f.1.10.2008),the third proviso to sub-section (2A) provides that if such
appeal is not decided within the period allowed originally or the periods so extended or allowed ,the order of stay
shall stand vacated after expiry of such period or periods.
The intention behind these provisions has been very clear that the Appellate tribunal cannot grant stay either
under the original order or any other subsequent order, beyond the period of 365 days in aggregate.
If the Tribunal is unable to decide the appeal on the basis of materials before it, it may admit fresh evidence and
decide the appeal. It may also keep the appeal pending and direct any one of the subordinate authorities to
ascertain further facts.

PROCEDURE OF APPELLATE TRIBUNAL (SECTION 255)
The powers and functions of the Appellate Tribunal may be exercised and discharged by benches constituted by
the President of the Appellate Tribunal from amongst the members thereof. The bench shall consist of one
judicial member and one accountant member.
The President or any other member of the Appellate Tribunal, authorised in this behalf by the Central Government,
may, sitting singly, dispose of any case which has been allotted to the Bench of which he is a member and which
pertains to an assessee whose, total income as computed by the Assessing Officer in the case does not exceed
` 50,00,000 [Amendment vide Finance Act, 2016]. The President may, for the disposal of any particular case,
constitute a Special Bench consisting of three or more members, one of whom shall necessarily be a judicial
member and one an accountant member.
If the members of a Bench differ in opinion on any point, the point shall be decided according to the opinion of
the majority if there is a majority. But if the members are equally divided, they shall state the point or points on
which they differ and the case shall be referred by the President of the Appellate Tribunal for hearing on such
point or points by one or more of the other members of the Appellate Tribunal. Such point or points shall be
decided according to the opinion of the majority of the members of the Appellate Tribunal who have heard the
case including those who first heard it.
The Appellate Tribunal shall have the power to regulate its own procedure and the procedure of Benches
thereof in all matters arising out of the exercise of its powers or of the discharge of its functions including the
places at which the Benches shall hold their sittings.
The Appellate Tribunal shall have, for the purpose of discharging its functions, all the powers which are vested
in the Income-tax authorities under Section 131, and any proceeding before the Appellate Tribunal shall be

Lesson 12

Appeals, Revisions, Settlement of Cases and Penalties & Offences

567

deemed to be a judicial proceeding and for the purpose of Section 196 of the Indian Penal Code, the Appellate
Tribunal shall be deemed to be a Civil Court for all purposes of Section 195 and Chapter XXXV of the Code of
Criminal Procedure.
The Appellate Tribunal is a final fact finding authority and if it arrives at its own conclusions or facts after the
consideration of the evidence before it, the Court will not interfere. It is necessary, however, that every fact ‘for’
and ‘against’ the assessee must have been considered with due care and the Tribunal must have given its
finding in a manner which would have clearly indicated what were the questions which arose for determination,
what was the evidence pro and contra in regard to each one of them, and what were the findings reached on the
evidence on record before it.

APPEAL TO HIGH COURT
Sections 260A and 260B are inserted w.e.f. October 1, 1998. Section 260A provides that an appeal shall lie to
the High Court from every order passed in appeal by the Appellate Tribunal if the High Court is satisfied that the
case involves a substantial question of law.
The Chief Commissioner or the Commissioner or an assessee aggrieved by any order passed by the Appellate
Tribunal may file an appeal to the High Court and such appeal shall be filed within 120 days of the date on which
the order appealed against is received by the assessee or the Chief Commissioner or Commissioner and shall
be filed in the form of memorandum of appeal precisely stating the substantial question of law involved.
If the High Court is satisfied that a substantial question of law is involved in any case, it shall formulate that
question. The appeal shall be heard only on the question so formulated, and the respondents shall at the
hearing of the appeal, be allowed to argue that the case does not involve such question. However, the High
Court may for reasons to be recorded, hear the appeal on any other substantial question of law not formulated
by it, if it is satisfied that the case involves such question.
The High Court shall decide the question of law so formulated and deliver such judgment thereon containing the
grounds on which such decision is founded and may award such cost as it deems fit.
The High Court may determine any issue which has not been determined by the Appellate Tribunal or has been
wrongly determined by the Appellate Tribunal on such substantial question of law.
Where the High Court delivers a judgement in an appeal filed before it under Section 260A, effect shall be given
to the order passed on the appeal by the Assessing Officer on the basis of a certified copy of judgement [Section
260(1A)].
Section 260B provides that an appeal filed under Section 260A shall be heard by a bench of not less than two
judges of the High Court and shall be decided in accordance with the opinion such Judges or the majority, if any.
Where, however, there is no such majority, the part of law upon which they differ shall be referred to one or more
of the Judges of the High Court and shall be decided according to the opinion of the majority of the Judges who
have heard the case including those who first heard it.
The High Court also has power to stay a proceeding for recovery of demand arising out of the assessment order
pending disposal of appeal.

APPEAL TO THE SUPREME COURT (SECTION 261)
The aggrieved party is entitled to appeal to the Supreme Court against the judgment delivered by the High Court
on the reference application made to it by the Tribunal (under Section 256) against an order made under Section
254 before the 1st day of October, 1998 or an appeal made to High Court in respect of an order passed under
Section 254 on or after that date provided the High Court certifies the case to be fit for appeal to the Supreme
Court. The right of appeal is, therefore, conditional and may be availed of only if the High Court gives a certificate
of such fitness.

568 EP-TL&P
The High Court could certify the case as a fit one for appeal and grant leave to the Supreme Court if a substantial
question of law is involved or if the question is likely to come up in successive year or if the question is otherwise
of great public or private importance.
An application of fitness for appeal to the Supreme Court has to be made within 60 days from the date of High
Court’s judgment (under Article 132 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1963). The time required for taking a
certified copy of the High Court’s judgment is to be excluded in computing such period of limitation.
If the High Court refuses to certify a case to be fit for appeal to the Supreme Court, an application may be made
to the Supreme Court (under Article 136 of the Constitution) for special leave to appeal against the decision of
the High Court.
The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 relating to the appeal to the Supreme Court are applicable
in the case of appeals under Section 261 in the same manner as they are applicable in the case of appeals from
decrees of a High Court [Section 262(1)].
Where the judgment of the High Court is changed or reversed in the appeal, effect is given to the order of the
Supreme Court [Section 262(3)]. The law declared by the Supreme Court is binding on all courts within the
territory of India under Article 141 of the Constitution.
On the receipt of a copy of judgment, the Appellate Tribunal has to pass such orders as are necessary to
dispose of the case conformably to such judgment.
To award the cost of an appeal is at the discretion the Supreme Court
[Section 262(2)]. It would be open to the Court not to award costs even to the party which has succeeded in the
appeal before it. If the Supreme Court awards costs to a party and the party has not complied with the order, a
petition may be made to the appropriate High Court for execution of the order of the Supreme Court (Section
266). The High Court may transmit the order for execution to any court subordinate to it (Section 266).
Section 257 enables the Appellate Tribunal to make a direct reference to the Supreme Court if the Tribunal is of
the opinion that, on account of a conflict in the decision of High Court in respect of any particular question of law,
it is expedient that a reference should be made directly to the highest court.

SETTLEMENT OF CASES [Sections 245A to 245L]
Chapter XIXA provides for settlement of the cases which may be pending before an Income-tax authority.
Further an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal by the assessee, and which is pending before it, may be withdrawn
by the assessee with the permission of the tribunal, to have his case settled under Sections 245A to 245L.
Accordingly the Central Government constituted an Income-tax Settlement Commission consisting of a chairman
and as many Vice- Chairman and other members as considered appropriate by the Central Government from
amongst persons of integrity and outstanding ability, having special knowledge of, and, experience in problems
relating to direct taxes and business accounts. However, in the event of a member of the CBDT having been
appointed as the Chairman, Vice-Chairman or member of the Commission, he shall cease to be a member of
the Board.

DEFAULTS AND PENALTIES
An assessee should note that compliance with legal formalities is less costly than the payment of penalties or
interest on tax dues. There are several formalities to be complied with to avoid any penalty. In this connection,
reference may be made to the following table summarizing the defaults and penalties therefor.
Chapters XVII and XXI of Income-tax Act, 1961, contain various provisions empowering an Income-tax Authority to
levy penalty in case of certain defaults. The various types of penalties are briefly described in the table given below:

The existing provisions relating to levy of penalty u/s 271(1)(c) due to concealment of income or furnishing of
inaccurate particulars of income by the taxpayer is to be replaced by a new section 270A categorizing the
defaults into two categories viz. under-reporting of income and misreporting of income.
Under-reporting of Income

Misreporting of Income

• the income assessed is greater than the income • misrepresentation or suppression of facts;
determined in the return processed under clause
(a) of sub-section (1) of section 143;
• the income assessed is greater than the
maximum amount not chargeable to tax, where
no return of income has been furnished;

• non-recording of investments in books of account;

• the income reassessed is greater than the
income assessed or reassessed immediately
before such re-assessment;

• claiming of expenditure not substantiated by

• the amount of deemed total income assessed
• recording of false entry in books of account
or reassessed as per the provisions of section
115JB or 115JC, as the case may be, is greater
than the deemed total income determined in the
return processed under clause (a) of sub-section
(1) of section 143;
• the amount of deemed total income assessed as • failure to record any receipt in books of account

section 115JC (MAT or AMT) is greater than
deemed total income assessed/ reassessed under

LESSON ROUND UP
– The right to appeal must be given by express enactment in the Act. Therefore, in case there is no
provision in the Act for filing an appeal regarding a particular matter, no appeal shall lie. The right to
appeal arises where the taxpayer is aggrieved by the order passed by the income-tax authority.
– The assessee may prefer an appeal against the orders of the Assessing Officer to the Commissioner
(Appeals), in accordance with the relevant provisions under Section 246 and appeal against the order
of the Commissioner (Appeals) can be preferred by the Assessee or the Commissioner of Income Tax
and such appeal lies with the Appellate Tribunal.
– The Central Government shall constitute an Appellate Tribunal consisting of as many judicial and
accountant members as it thinks fit to exercise the powers and discharge the functions conferred on
the Appellate Tribunal by this Act.
– Section 260A provides that an appeal shall lie to the High Court from every order passed in appeal
by the Appellate Tribunal if the High Court is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question
of law.
– The aggrieved party is entitled to appeal to the Supreme Court against the judgment delivered by the
High Court.
– Chapter XIXA provides for settlement of the cases which may be pending before an Income-tax authority.
Further an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal by the assessee, and which is pending before it, may be
withdrawn by the assessee with the permission of the tribunal, to have his case settled under Sections
245A to 245L.
– “Case” means any proceeding for assessment under this Act, of any person in respect of any
assessment year or assessment years, which may be pending before an Assessing Officer on the
date on which an application under Section 245C(1) is made.
– An assessee may, at any stage of a case relating to him, make an application in the prescribed Form
(Form No.34B) along with the prescribed fee to the Settlement Commission to settle the case.
– Chapters XVII and XXI of Income-tax Act, 1961, contain various provisions empowering an Incometax Authority to levy penalty in case of certain defaults.

CONCEPT OF TAX PLANNING
Tax Planning is an exercise undertaken to minimize tax liability through the best use of all available allowances,
deductions, exclusions, exemptions, etc., to reduce income and/or capital gains.
Tax planning can be defined as an arrangement of one’s financial and business affairs by taking legitimately in
full benefit of all deductions, exemptions, allowances and rebates so that tax liability reduces to minimum. In
other words, all arrangements by which the tax is saved by ways and means which comply with the legal
obligations and requirements and are not colourable devices or tactics to meet the letters of law but not the spirit
behind these, would constitute tax planning.
The Hon’ble Supreme Court in McDowell & Co. v. CTO (1985) 154 ITR 148 has observed that “tax planning may
be legitimate provided it is within the framework of the law. Colourable devices cannot be part of tax planning
and it is wrong to encourage or entertain the belief that it is honourable to avoid payment of tax by resorting to
dubious methods.” Tax planning should not be done with intent to defraud the revenue; though all transactions
entered into by an assessee could be legally correct, yet on the whole these transactions may be devised to
defraud the revenue. All such devices where statute is followed in strict words but actual spirit behind the statute
is marred would be termed as colourable devices such devices do not form part of tax planning. All transactions
in respect of tax planning must be in accordance with the true spirit of statute and should be correct in form and
substance.
Various judicial pronouncements have laid down the principle that substance and form of the transactions shall
be seen in totality to determine the net effect of a particular transaction. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case
of CIT v. B M Kharwar (1969) 72 ITR 603 has held that, “ The tax authority is entitled and is indeed bound to
determine the true legal relation resulting from a transaction. If the parties have chosen to conceal by a device
the legal relation, it is open to the tax authorities to unravel the device and determine the true character of
relationship. But the legal effect of a transaction can not be displaced by probing into substance of the transaction.”
The form and substance of a transaction is real test of any tax-planning device. The form of transaction refers to
transaction, as it appears superficially and the real intention behind such transaction may remain concealed.
Substance of a transaction refers to lifting the veil of legal documents and ascertaining the true intention of
parties behind the transaction.
How Tax is levied
Before discussing the concept of tax planning in detail, it is essential to understand how tax is levied.
Though wide latitude is given to the legislature in the matter of levy of taxes, what is needed is that the tax/
statute should be constitutionally valid to pass the muster of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
Article 265 of the Constitution of India prescribes that “no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority”.
Moreover, no tax is complete under a fiscal statute unless the subject, the object and the quantum of tax are
prescribed or indicated in the provision. In doing so, there can be different rates of tax levied upon the nature of
business/profession carried on or depending on the capacity of the person to pay the tax and/or other relevant
consideration. No income should be taxed presumptively. There is no equity about taxation and no income
should be taxed twice.
It is now well settled that a modern State, particularly when exercising powers of taxation, has to deal with
complex factors/relating to the objects to be taxed, tax to be levied, the social and economic policies etc. Thus,
the liability of tax depends upon the charging section in the statute vis-a-vis ‘taxable person’, ‘taxable event’ and
‘subject matter of taxation’. For understanding these inter-related but distinct concepts reference may be made
to the Supreme Court’s decision in State of Tamil Nadu v. M.K. Kandaswami (1975, 36 STC 191).

TAX PLANNING, TAX AVOIDANCE AND TAX EVASION
In India the tax laws are admittedly complicated because of various deductions, exemptions, relief and rebates.
Therefore, it is only logical that taxpayers generally plan their affairs so as to attract the least incidence of tax.
However, practice of avoidance is worldwide phenomenon and there is always a continuing battle in this regard
between the taxpayer and the tax collector. The perceptions of both are different. The taxpayer spares no efforts
in maximising his profits and attracting the least incidence. The tax gatherer, on the other hand, tries to break the
plans whose sole objective is to save taxes.
TAX PRACTICES

TAX PLANNING

TAX EVASION

TAX AVOIDANCE

In the context of saving tax, there are three commonly used practices, namely (a) Tax Evasion; (b) Tax Avoidance;
(c) Tax Planning. They are being considered in greater details in subsequent discussion.
(a) TAX EVASION
It refers to a situation where a person tries to reduce his tax liability by deliberately suppressing the income or by
inflating the expenditure showing the income lower than the actual income and resorting to various types of
deliberate manipulations.
An assessee guilty of tax evasion is punishable under the relevant laws. Tax evasion may involve stating an
untrue statement knowingly, submitting misleading documents, suppression of facts, not maintaining proper
accounts of income earned (if required under the law) omission of material facts in assessments. An assessee
who dishonestly claims the benefit under the statute by making false statements, would be guilty of tax evasion.
Tax evasion is a method of evading tax liability by dishonest means like suppression, showing lower incomes,
conscious violation of rules, inflation of expenses etc. This device has to be condemned. It is a dubious way of
attempting to get tax gains. A tax evader has to pay not only penalty but he also incurs the risk of being prosecuted.
Tax evasion can never be construed as tax planning because it amounts to breaking of law whereas tax planning
is devised within the legal framework by availing of what the legislature provides. Tax planning ensures not only
accrual of tax benefits within the four corners of law but it also ensures that tax obligations are properly discharged
so as to avoid penal provisions.
(b) TAX AVOIDANCE
The line of demarcation between tax planning and tax avoidance is very thin and blurred. There could be
elements of malafide motive involved in tax avoidance also. Any planning which, though done strictly according
to legal requirements, defeats the basic intention of the Legislature behind the statute could be termed as
instance of tax avoidance. It is usually done by taking full advantage of loopholes adjusting the affairs in such a
manner that there is no infringement of taxation laws and least taxes are attracted.
Earlier tax avoidance was considered completely legitimate, but at present it may be illegitimate in certain
situations. In the judgement of the Supreme Court in McDowell’s case 1985 (154 ITR 148) SC, tax avoidance
has been considered as heinous as tax evasion and a crime against society. Most of the amendments are now
aimed at curbing practice of tax avoidance.

592 EP-TL&P
McDowell & Co. Ltd. Vs Commercial tax Officer (1985)
Supreme Court observed – “we think time has come for us to depart from Westminster principle.......tax
planning may be legitimate provided it is within the framework of law. Colourable devices cannot be part of tax
planning and it is wrong to encourage and entertain the belief that it is honourable to avoid the payment of tax
by resorting to dubious methods. It is the obligation of every citizen to pay honestly without resorting to
subterfuges.”
The type of cases that come under ‘Tax avoidance’ are those where the tax payer has apparently circumvented
the law (without giving rise to an offence) by using a scheme, arrangement or device though of a complex nature
with the main or sole purpose of deferring, reducing or completely avoid the tax payable under the law.
Sometimes, the avoidance is accomplished by shifting the liability for tax to other person not at arm’s length in
whose hands the tax payable is reduced or eliminated. According to G.S.A. Wheat Craft, “tax avoidance is the
act of dodging tax without actually breaking the law”. It is a method of reducing incidence of tax by taking
advantages of certain loopholes of tax laws. Thus, the line of demarcation between tax avoidance and tax
planning is very thin and blurred. There is an element of malafide motive involved in tax avoidance.
The Royal Commission on Taxation for Canada has explained the concept of tax avoidance as under :
For our purposes the expression “Tax Avoidance” will be used to describe every attempt by legal means to
prevent or reduce tax liability which would otherwise be incurred, by taking advantage of some provisions or lack
of provisions of law. It excludes fraud, concealment or other illegal measures”.
(c) TAX PLANNING
It means arranging the financial activities in such a way that maximum tax benefits are enjoyed by making use
of all beneficial provisions in the tax laws which entitle the assessee to get certain rebates and reliefs. This is
permitted and not frowned upon by law.
Thus, tax planning would imply compliance with the taxation provisions in such a manner that full advantage is
taken of all tax exemptions, deductions, concessions, rebates and reliefs permissible under the Income Tax Act
so that the incidence of tax is the least.
Tax planning can neither be equated to tax evasion nor to tax avoidance. It is the scientific planning of the
assesee’s operations to minimize, postpone or defer the tax liability by availing various incentives, concessions,
allowances, rebates and relief’s provided for in the tax laws. They are meant to be availed of and they have
certain clear objectives to achieve.
Tax planning may, therefore, be regarded as a method of intelligent application of expert knowledge of planning
a person’s affairs with a view of securing consciously provided tax benefits on the basis of the national priorities
in consonance with the interests of the State and the public.
Therefore, notwithstanding the legal rulings in cases like McDowell and its English parallels, real and genuine
transactions aimed at a valid tax planning cannot be turned down merely on grounds of reduction of the tax burden.
Flexibility has to be considered as a practical feature in a tax system.
While planning a scheme relating to tax affairs, tax planner need to assure that tax planning device does not
loses its efficiency due to changes in law. It would be a shortsighted perspective to think of a planning device
that is in conformity with the law as it exists, but gets nullified by a subsequent change in law specially where the
change is of a retrospective nature. Hence, the tax plan has to be flexible in nature and the planner has to
comprehend about the future scenario too while devising a plan to save tax.

OBJECTIVE OF TAX PLANNING
Tax planning, is honest and rightful approach to the attainment of maximum benefits of the taxation laws within
their framework. Therefore, the objectives of tax planning cannot be regarded as offending any concept of the
taxation laws and subjected to reprehension of reducing the inflow of revenue to the Government’s coffers, so
long as the tax planning measures are in conformity with the statute laws and the judicial expositions thereof.
The basic objectives of tax planning are:
(a) Reduction of tax liability
(b) Minimisation of litigation
(c) Productive investment
(d) Healthy growth of economy
(e) Economic stability
(a) Reduction of tax liability
In this context, a tax payer can derive the maximum savings by arranging his affairs in accordance with the
requirements of law, as contained in the fiscal statutes. In many a cases, a taxpayer may suffer heavy taxation
not on account of the dosage of tax administered by the Act, but, because of his lack of awareness of the legal
requirements. Since every taxpayer wishes to retain a maximum part of his earnings, rather than parting with it

594 EP-TL&P
and facing the resource crunch, it would be to his benefit to plan his tax affairs properly and avail the deductions
and exemption admissible under the Act (s). He can succeed in doing so by being an aware of the implications
of the various business/other transactions and the various concessions for which he is eligible.
(b) Minimisation of litigation
A general visualisation of the tax administration scenario depicts a tug-of-war between the tax payers and tax
collectors the tax payers trying their maximum to pay the least tax and the tax administrator are attempting to
extract the maximum. This sometimes results in protracted litigations. It is in this context that a sound tax
planning pays dividends. Where a proper tax planning is adopted by the tax payer in conformity with the
provisions of the taxation laws, the incidence of litigation is minimised. This saves him from the hardships and
inconveniences caused by the unnecessary litigations, which at times may stretch upto the levels of High/
Supreme Court:
(c) Productive Investment
Channelisation, of taxable income to the various investment schemes is one of the prime objectives of tax
planning as it is aimed to attain twin-objectives of : (i) harnessing the resources for socially productive projects,
and, (ii) relieving the tax payer from the burden of taxation, converting the earnings into means of further earnings.
Legal awareness of the avenues so provided by the Government negates the need of avoidance/evasion of tax
and lend authenticity to the investments made.
(d) Healthy Growth of Economy
The growth of a nation’s economy is synonymous with the growth and prosperity of its citizens. In this context,
a saving of earnings by legally sanctioned devices fosters the growth of both. Tax-planning measures are aimed
at generating white money having a free flow and generation without reservations for the overall progress of the
nation. Conversely, savings by dibious means lead to generation of black money, the evils of which are obvious.
Tax planning thus assumes a great significance in this context.
(e) Economic Stability
In the context of the case, M.V.Valliapan v. ITO, (1988) 170 ITR 238 (Mad.), by a proper tax planning, a smooth
flow without any recriminations of taxes ensured is between the tax payer and the tax administrator. This results
in economic stability by way of: (i) availing of avenues for productive investments by the tax payers and,
(ii) harnessing of resources for national projects aimed at general prosperity of the national economy and (iii)
reaping of benefits even by those not liable to pay tax on their incomes.

ESSENTIALS OF TAX PLANNING
Successful tax planning techniques should have following attributes :
(a) It should be based on upto date knowledge of tax laws. Assesees must have an upto date knowledge of
the statute he must also be aware of judgments of the courts, the circulars, notifications, clarifications
and Administrative instructions issued by the CBDT from time to time.
(b) The disclosure of all material information and furnishing the same to the income-tax department is an
absolute pre-requisite of tax planning the concealment in any form would attract the penalty often ranging
from 100 to 300% of the amount of tax sought to be evaded. Section 271(1)(c) read together with
explanations there to.
(c) Whatever is planned should not simply satisfy the requirements of legal provisions as stated but should
also be within the framework of law. It means that the use of sham transactions and colourable devices,
with a view to circumvent the legal provisions, must be avoided.

Lesson 13

Tax Planning & Tax Management

595

Every citizen is obliged to honestly pay the taxes. Therefore, colourable devices resorted to by the tax
payers for evading a tax liability will have to be ignored by the court. Accordingly, a tax planning within
the four corners of the taxation laws is not to be turned down only because it legitimately reduces the tax
inflow to the Government. A genuine tax-planning device, aimed to overcome heavy burden of taxation
while carrying out the rules of law and Court’s decisions is fully valid.
(d) Foresight is the essence of a business and the tax planning should also reflect this essence. Tax regime
is flexible in nature and tax planning model must also be flexible so that it could be scrutinised in relative
situations.

TYPES OF TAX PLANNING
The tax planning exercise ranges from devising a model for specific transaction as well as for systematic corporate
planning. These are:
(a) Short-range and long-range tax planning.
(b) Permissive tax planning.
(c) Purposive tax planning.
(a) Short-range planning & Long-range planning
Short-range planning refers to year to year planning to achieve some specific or limited objective. For example,
an individual assessee whose income is likely to register unusual growth in particular year as compared to the
preceding year, may plan to subscribe to the PPF/NSC’s within the prescribed limits in order to enjoy substantive
tax relief. By investing in such a way, he is not making permanent commitment but is substantially saving in the
tax. It is one of the examples of short-range planning.
Long-range planning on the other hand, involves entering into activities, which may not pay-off immediately. For
example, when an assessee transfers his equity shares to his minor son he knows that the Income from the
shares will be clubbed with his own income. But clubbing would also cease after minor attains majority.
(b) Permissive tax planning
Permissive tax planning is tax planning under the expressed provisions of tax laws. Tax laws of our country offer
many exemptions and incentives.
(c) Purposive tax planning
Purposive tax planning is based on the measures which circumvent the law. The permissive tax planning has
the express sanction of the Statute while the purposive tax planning does not carry such sanction. For example,
under Sections 60 to 65 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 the income of the other persons is clubbed in the income of
the assessee. If the assessee is in a position to plan in such a way that these provisions do not get attracted,
Such a plan would work in favour of the tax payer because it would increase his disposable resources. Such a
tax plan could be termed as ‘Purposive Tax Planning’.

IMPORTANCE OF TAX PLANNING
We cannot deny the fact that tax planning is important for reducing the tax liability. It is also considered important
on account of the following factors :
(i) When an assessee has not claimed all the deductions and relief, before the assessment is completed,
he is not allowed to claim them at that the time of appeal. It was held in CIT v. Gurjargravures Ltd. (1972)
84 ITR 723 that if there is no tax planning and there are lapses on the part of the assessee, the benefit
would be the least.

596 EP-TL&P
(ii) Tax planning exercise is more reliable since the Companies Act, 2013 and other allied laws narrow
down the scope for tax evasion and tax avoidance techniques, driving a taxpayer to a situation where he
will be subjected to severe penal consequences.
(iii) Presently, companies are supposed to promote those activities and programmes, which are of public
interest and good for a civilised society. In order to encourage these, the Government has provided
them with incentives in the tax laws. Hence a planner has to be well versed with the law concerning
incentives.
(iv) With increase in profits, the quantum of corporate tax also increases and it necessitates the devotion of
adequate time on tax planning.
(v) Tax planning enables a company to bear the burden of both direct and indirect taxation during inflation.
It enables companies to make proper expense planning, capital budget planning, sales promotion planning
etc.
(vi) Capital formation helps in replacing the technologically obsolete and outdated plant and machinery
and enables the carrying on of manufacturing operation with a new and more sophisticated system
and the need for capital formation in the corporate sector cannot be ignored. However, heavy taxation
reduces the inflow of corporate funds which could otherwise be used for capital formation, repairs,
renewals, modernisation or replacement of plant and machinery. Proper implementation of tax planning
techniques assist companies in taking rational decisions related to aforementioned activities thereby
helping them in saving tax.
(vii) In these days of credit squeeze and dear money conditions, even a rupee of tax decently saved may be
taken as an interest-free loan from the Government, which perhaps, an assessee need not repay.
Thus, any legitimate step taken by an assessee directed towards maximising tax benefits, keeping in view the
intention of law, will not only help him but also help the society and promote actual the spirit behind the legal
provisions. All the assesees who practice tax planning may have the satisfaction that they are contributing their
best to the nation’s broad objectives and goals in a welfare State like ours. Also, the law makes the fulfillment of
certain conditions obligatory before allowing the benefits to be claimed by the assesees. In this way, the assesees,
besides helping themselves, also help in securing the objectives, tasks and goals set before them by the country.

DIVERSION OF INCOME AND APPLICATION OF INCOME
The Supreme Court’s verdict in CIT v. Sitaldas Tirthdas (1961) 41 ITR 367 is the authority for the proposition that
where by an obligation income is diverted before it reaches the assessee, it is deductible from his income as for
all practical purposes it is not his income at all but where the income is required to be applied to discharge an
obligation after it reaches the assessee, it is not deductible. Thus, there is the difference between diversion of
income by an overriding title and application of income as the former is deductible while the latter is not. Thus,
when management of a company is taken over by another person from the existing team in consideration of
percentage of future profits to the latter, in computing the business income of the former, such percentage of
profits is deductible [CIT v. Travancore Sugars and Chemicals Ltd. (1973) 88 ITR 1 (SC). Management agreements
must therefore be drafted with caution.
The Delhi High Court’s verdict in CIT v. Stellar Investments Ltd. (1991) 192 ITR 287 to the effect that the Assessing
Officer in terms of the power available to him under Section 68 of the Act, is not precluded from ascertaining the
genuineness of the share capital, must be needed. There have been occasions when unscrupulous promoters
have ploughed back their black money into new companies by subscribing to shares in thousands of fictitious
names. If the bluff is called, the unexplained credit in the form of share capital would be treated as income under
Section 68 of the Act.

AREAS OF TAX PLANNING IN THE CONTEXT OF INCOME TAX ACT, 1961
Some of the important areas of tax planning are as under:
(a) Setting up and commencement of a business
(b) Form of organisation/ownership pattern;
(c) Locational aspects;
(d) Nature of business.
(e) Tax planning in respect of corporate restructuring;
(f) Tax planning in respect of financial management;
(g) Tax planning in respect of Non-Residents.
(h) Tax planning for Indian Collaborators
(i) Tax planning in respect of employees;

(a) SETTING UP AND COMMENCEMENT OF BUSINESS
Setting up a business within the scope of the Income Tax Act is a particular point to be considered for the
purpose of tax planning strategy. It is different from the commencement of business. The company may be
incurring certain expenditure of revenue nature during the intervening period after setting up and before the
commencement of business (production). It is provided in the tax laws that the general expenses prior to the
date of setting up are inadmissible but those incurred from the date of setting up and before the commencement
of the business may be allowed as deduction for tax purposes provided they are of revenue nature and are
incurred wholly and exclusively for the purpose of business.
From the decisions of the Bombay High Court in Western India Vegetable Products Ltd. v. CIT [(1954) 26 ITR
151 (Bom)] and the Supreme Court in CIT v. Ramaraju Surgical Cotton Mills Ltd. [(1967) 63 ITR 478 (SC)] and
Travancore Cochin Chemical Pvt. Ltd. v. CIT [(1967) 65 ITR 651 (SC)], it has been well settled that a business
is set up as soon as it is ready to commence production and it is not necessary that the actual production should
be also commenced. It is also observed that the business commences with the start of first activity at a point of
time, which must necessarily precede other activity.
In the case of CIT v. Saurashtra Cement and Chemical Industries Ltd. [(1973) 91 ITR 170 (Guj.)], the decision of
the Gujarat High Court is worth noting. In this case the company was established for manufacturing cement. The
court observed that :
“the business is set up as soon as acquiring of lime stone is commenced even if at that time, the plant and
machinery may not have been installed so that actual manufacturing operations may commence. They have
expressed the view that the business commences with the start of activity which is first in point of time and
which must necessarily precede other activities. The court observed that the business comprises several
activities. Starting of one of those activities may in some circumstances fulfil the principal condition of setting
up of a business. All the activities of the business need not be started simultaneously. But when an activity,
which is the first in order of sequence preceding other activities is started, then it can be said that the company
has been set up.”
In the case of Commissioner of Income-Tax v. Saurashtra Cement and Chemical Industries Ltd. (1973, 91 ITR
170) the Gujarat High court had, inter alia, held that ‘Business’ connoted a continuous course of activities. All the
activities which make up the business need not be started simultaneously in order that the business may
commence. The business would commence when the activity which is first in point of time and which must
necessarily precede all other activities is started.

598 EP-TL&P
Reliance on the above case was placed by the Allahabad High Court in the case of Modi Industries Ltd. v.
Commissioner of Income Tax (1977, 110 ITR 855), while deciding the question of allowance of business
expenditure, it was held that the foreign tour expenses of the chairman for setting up of two new factories were
not - allowable as business expenditure under Section 37 and were of a capital nature.
The ruling of the Gujarat High Court was applied by it in the case of Hotel Alankar v. Commissioner of Income
Tax (1982, 133 ITR 866) holding that when a business is established and is ready to commence business, it can
be said of that business that it has been set up. The words ‘ready to commence' would not necessarily mean
that all the integrated activities are fully carried out and/or Wholly completed. This requirement is also complied
with in a given case where an assessee had undertaken the first of the kind of integrated activities of which the
business in overall comprised of, the question whether a business has been set-up or not is always a question
of fact which has to be decided on the facts and in the circumstances of the case subject to the broad guidelines
provided by different decisions in that behalf.
With regard to setting up of business and commencement of business, there is another decision of the Gujarat
High Court in the case of Sarabhai Management Corporation Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax (1976), 102
ITR 25 where it has held that, it is only after the business is setup that the previous year of that business
commences and any expenses incurred prior to the setting up of a business would be of capital nature and not
a permissible deduction. There may, however, be an interval between the setting up of the business and the
commencement of the business, all expenses incurred during that interval would be a permissible deduction.
Applying this decision, the Punjab and Haryana High Court in the case of Commissioner of Income-Tax v. O.P.
Khanna and Sons (1983, 140 ITR 558) (the assessee carried on business of printing press, purchased a new
building in November 1970, installed electrical fittings and shifted to the building in Sept. 1971) held that during
transitory period the building had been ‘used’ by the assessee and the depreciation allowance had to be made
in respect of it while computing its business income.
The Gujarat High Court’s decision in the case of Sarabhai Management Corporation Ltd. (supra) had been
affirmed by the Supreme Court in Commissioner of Income Tax v. Sarabhai Management Corporation Ltd.
(1991, 192 ITR 151) holding that even if the acquisition of the property for being let out could be said to be only
the preparatory stage, the subsequent activities constituted activities in the course of the carrying on the assessee’s
business. It was not correct to treat the assessee as having commenced business only when the licensee or
lessee occupied the premises or started paying rent. The High Court was held to be right in interfering with the
finding of the Tribunal which was based on a mis-direction in law.
The Andhra Pradesh High Court laid down the following principles to determine whether a business has
commenced or not in Commissioner Income Tax v. Sponge Iron India Ltd. (1993, 201 ITR 770):
Whether a business has commenced or not is a question of fact.
(i) There is a distinction between the setting up of business and the commencement of business.
(ii) Where the business consists of a continuous course of activities, for commencement of business all
the activities which go to make up the business need not be started simultaneously. As soon as an
activity which has the essential activity in the course of carrying on the business is started, the business
must be said to have commenced.
In this case it was held, on facts, that since the business had not commenced, the interest income could not be
treated as business income. It was also held that the assessee was not entitled to the deduction of the
administrative expenses and exploration and mining expenses from out of its interest income.
Income from pending setting up of business : It is possible that pending setting up of business the funds raised
by a company may be invested temporarily so that they do not remain idle. Income from such investments is
taxable under income from other sources’. Expenses on pending setting up of business like salary to staff, office
expenses etc. cannot be deducted from such investment income [Traco Cable Co. Ltd. v. CIT (1969) 72 ITR 503

Lesson 13

Tax Planning & Tax Management

599

(Ker.)]. Companies in such a scenario are in an unenviable position. On the one hand they are incurring expenses
which go a begging and on the other, they have income from investments which are taxed. The Madras High
Court in CIT v. Seshasayee Paper & Boards Ltd. (1985) 156 ITR 542 (Mad.)] held that set off under Section 72
of the Act is also not possible because the expenses on business if they are not allowable as a deduction,
cannot assume the form of loss either so as to qualify for set off against income from investments. Companies
may therefore expedite setting up of business so that the business loss may be set off against such income from
other sources.
It may be noted that the view expounded by the Madras High Court in Seshasayee (supra) has been endorsed
by the Supreme Court in Tuticornn Alkale Chemicals & Fertilisers Ltd. v. CIT (1997) 27 CLA 41. In a subsequent
judgement CIT v. Bokare Steel Ltd. (1999) 33 CLA (Sur.) 18, however the Supreme Court has pointed out that
where it is possible to establish a link between investment income pending commencement of business with the
cost of project, the same can be reduced from the cost of assets.

(b) FORM OF THE ORGANISATION
The first aspect of setting up of new business entity is deciding the form of organisation/ownership pattern. The
selection of particular form of organisation depends not only on the magnitude of financial requirements and
owner’s liability, but also on the tax considerations. In the case of a company, the law interferes with the corporate
planning process from the moment it comes into existence. At times, tax laws affect even the periods prior to the
existence of a company and it can also extend upto the point of time when the company ceases to exist. For
example, a director of a private limited company in liquidation, has to keep in view the provisions of Sections 178
and 179 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 dealing with misfeasance etc. Normally, depending upon the level of
operation, expected profitability need for external financing and expected requirements of technical expertise, a
suitable form can be chosen. But in view of the continuity of business, the benefits arising out of limited liability,
organised accounting and the overall long-term tax benefits flowing to the company form of organisation, the
corporate enterprise may be regarded as an effective instrument of tax planning. The company being a separate
legal entity, confers certain valuable benefits in the matter of tax planning to its shareholders and the persons
connected with the management of the company.
Tax liability is an important consideration guiding the choice of a legal form of business organisation. In some
circumstances however this consideration is of no significance. For example large business is generally
compelled to organise itself in the form of a company as this form of organisation makes it possible to raise
large amounts of capital required. Similarly retail business of small size can only be economically operated
as proprietorship or partnership firm. When there is freedom of choice taxation becomes an important
consideration.
(A) Company Form of Organisation
The important tax privileges and advantages to a company over the other forms can be summarized as under:
(i) Allowability of remuneration, for the persons who are managing the affairs of the company and also
owning its shares.
(ii) The provisions relating to clubbing of income under Section 64 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 do not apply
even if the business is carried on by family members through a company. This ultimately leads to
reduction of tax liability on the part of the individual members. However, if spouse of an individual having
a substantial interest in a company receives remuneration from the same company, such remuneration
is added to the income of the individual unless the spouse is technically or professionally qualified.
[Section 40A(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act, 1961].
(iii) Any income by way of dividend referred to in Section 115-O is exempt under Section 10(34).
(iv) Companies are subjected to flat rate of tax, regardless of the quantum of their income. The domestic

600 EP-TL&P
companies now pay tax @ 30% plus surcharge @ 7% (surcharge is applicable if their total income
exceeds ` 1 Crore but does not exceeds ` 10 Crore, if it exceeds ` 10 Crore then surcharge @ 12%), if
applicable and education cess @ 3%. The rate of tax for domestic company shall be 29% of the total
income (plus SC + SHEC) if the total turnover or gross receipts of the company in the previous year
2014-15 does not exceed 5 crores rupees. This, however, may not seem to be an advantage in view of
low slab rates applicable to sole proprietorships, but when we look at the total incidence of tax after
taking into account the various deductions allowed to companies and the scheme of perquisites, the
real owners of companies stand to benefit.
(v) In order to provide relief to newly setup domestic companies engaged solely in the business of
manufacture or production of article or thing, a new section 115BA inserted to provide that the incometax payable in respect of the total income of a domestic company for any previous year relevant to the
assessment year beginning on or after the 1st day of April, 2017 shall be computed @ 25% at the option
of the company, if, (a) the company has been setup and registered on or after 1st day of March, 2016 and is engaged in
the business of manufacture or production of any article or thing and is not engaged in any other
business;
(b) the company while computing its total income has not claimed any benefit under section 10AA,
benefit of accelerated depreciation, benefit of additional depreciation, investment allowance,
expenditure on scientific research and any deduction in respect of certain income under Part-C of
Chapter-VI-A other than the provisions of section 80JJAA; and
(c) the option is furnished in the prescribed manner before the due date of furnishing of income.
[Amendment vide Finance Act, 2016]
(vi) There are certain special tax concessions, allowances and deductions given under the Income Tax Act,
1961 available to the company form of business enterprises such as deductions allowed under Section
33AC and Sections 36(1)(ix) and 35D of the Income Tax Act, 1961 etc.
(vii) Incorporation of a company has the incidental advantage of attracting large capital since the
shareholder, who has to contribute only a miniscule part of the capital requirement, is assured of
limited liability and free transferability of his shares. Those shares in companies are treated as long
term capital assets qualifying for considerable leniency in taxation even if they are held by the assessee
for a small time of 12 months. This has made investment in the shares of companies all the more
attractive and helps the companies to generate the funds required for their development as well as
furtherance of their objects.
A compnay includes one person company, small companies, dormant company, etc. A company is regarded as
a separate legal entity. The minimum limit does not apply in its case. It is required to pay tax on every rupee of
its income. Besides the usual income tax at the flat rate prescribed by the respective Finance Acts, whatever
amount of tax is paid by a company is not deemed to have been paid on behalf of the shareholders. Therefore,
no rebate is allowed to shareholders in this regard as is the practice in advanced countries.
The relative tax burden of conducting business can be assessed by paying attention to the provisions of the
Income-tax Act, 1961, Income-tax Rules, 1962 and various other notifications and circulars issued from time to
time by the concerned authorities.
(B) Partnership Firm or Limited liability Partnership
A partnership form of organization is easy to establish. The only procedure for the formation of partnership is to
draw up a partnership deed and a nominal charge in terms of cost of stamps for the deed is to be incurred. This
form of organization is suitable due to the following factors:

Lesson 13

Tax Planning & Tax Management

601

– The decision making on important business matter is quick as compared to a company form of organization
because partners meet frequently together. Therefore, decision on any important business matter cannot
be delayed.
– The chance of getting involved in risky activities is very less because every important decision is made
with the concurrence of all the partners.
– As compared to sole proprietorship, the problem of raising additional resources is much less. Whenever
the business expands and it is necessary to raise finance, it will be easy to raise it by admitting a new
partner or raising it by way of borrowings because of number of partners and their joint and several
liability to pay the debts of the firm, the lenders will be more interested in lending.
– The firm can pay interest on capital and loan to partners at the maximum rate of 12% p.a. Further it can
also give remuneration to its working partners subject to the limits mentioned in Section 40(b).
– This form of organisation is suitable from income-tax point of view in such cases where the amount of
profit is not large and the partners of the firm do not have any other additional income except by way of
remuneration and interest from the partnership firm. In such a case the profit of the firm shall be lower
and the individual partners can also avail of the maximum ceiling of income exempt under the Incometax Act.
– The share in the profit of the partnership firm is exempt form tax under Section 10(2A) of the Income-tax Act.
– The risk as to losses and liability incurred is divided amongst the partners.
– As in the case of company form of organization where the change of business requires a long procedure,
there is no tedious procedure in the partnership form of organization. The business can be changed
only with the consent of partners.
– The firm is taxable at a flat rate of 30% + education cess @2% + SHEC @1% for assessment year
2017-18 after allowing interest and remuneration to working partners (if provided in the partnership
deed and subject to Section 40(b) of the Income-tax Act.
However this form of organization is not suitable due to the following reasons:
1. The risk taking capacity of the partners becomes limited. Every decision relating to important business
matters is made with the consultation of other partners, which restricts the risk taking activities which
may yield much higher profits.
2. As far as the operations of business are limited to small or medium scale, there is no problem in financing
the expansion of business operation. But when business gets expanded to a large scale, then it will be
suitable to adopt a company form of organization because partnership can be formed up to such number
as may be prescribed but not exceeding 100.
3. One of the main drawbacks is that one partner becomes liable for the acts of another. Therefore, a
partner is liable for the wrongs of another partner if it is done within the legal limits.
4. In the new scheme of assessment of partnership firms, the share of partners is exempt from tax under
Section 10(2A) but the partners remuneration and interest, subject to limit mentioned in Section 40(b),
is taxable in the hands of the partners under the head profits and gains of business or profession. Also,
the firm cannot claim deduction in respect of interest payable to partners in excess of 12% per annum.
5. Where the partnership firm does not comply with the requirements of Section 184 of the Income Tax Act,
although the firm shall be assessed as firm, it shall not be allowed any deduction on account of interest
and remuneration to its partners.
6. A partnership firm may come to a sudden closure of business on account of death, lunacy or insolvency.

602 EP-TL&P
In the case of a business running efficiently and profitably, such as happening will cause a great loss.
Also, dissolution will attract Section 45(4) which imposes tax liability in respect of capital gain arising on
transfer of capital assets from the firms to partners.
Entrepreneurs now have an alternative and innovative form of business organization i.e. Limited Liability
Partnership (LLP) which combines the benefits of company and general partnership form of business
organizations. LLP has separate legal entity, perpetual succession and limited liability of partners. From income
tax point of view it is treated same as general partnership firm therefore its profits will be taxed in the hands of the
LLP not in the hands of its partners.
(C) Sole proprietorship
The most common form of ownership found in the business world is sole proprietorship. In this form of organization,
the proprietor is the only owner of the business assesed and he is solely responsible for the affairs of the business.
– A sole proprietorship is easy to establish because of little interference of government regulations.
– The cost of adopting this form of organization is small because of there being no legal requirement.
– All the profits of the business go in the hands of proprietor himself.
– In case of persons carrying on business on small scale and having small income from other sources,
this form of organization would be suitable because the proprietor can avail of the ceiling of exempt
income as under:
For assessment year 2017-18:
(a) in case of individuals in India below 60 years of age.

2,50,000

(b) in case of individual resident in India who is of the age of 60 years or more
but below the age of 80 years at any time during the previous year

3,00,000

(c) in case individual who is the age of 80 years or above

5,00,000

The tax liability of the individual will be minimum as the individual is subject to income-tax at slab rate
and the maximum marginal rate of income-tax in his case is 30% plus education cess @2% plus SHEC
@1% for the assessment year 2017-18.
Surcharge to be levied @15% on individuals having income exceeding Rs. 1 crore (Amendment vide
Finance Act, 2016 w.e.f. 1st April, 2016).
– Besides the deductions which are allowed to all assesses under Chapter VIA, a sole proprietor, being
assessed as individual, is entitled to get certain deductions under the following sections:
(i) Section 80C relating to contributions to provident fund, life insurance premium, subscription to
certain equity shares or debentures, etc.
(ii) Section 80CCC relating to contribution to certain pension funds.
(iii) Section 80CCD relating to contribution to notified pension scheme of the Central Government.
(iv) Section 80D relating to medical insurance premia.
(v) Section 80DD relating to maintenance of a dependent who is a person with disability.
(vi) Section 80DDB relating to expenditure on medical treatment, etc.
(vii) Section 80E relating to interest taken for higher education.
(viii) Section 80G relating to donations to certain funds, charitable institutions, etc.
(ix) Section 80GG relating to rent paid.

Lesson 13

603

(x) Section 80QQB relating to royalty income, etc. of authors of certain books other than text books.
(xi) Section 80RRB relating to royalty on patents.
(xii) Section 80U relating to persons with disability.
However, this form of organization is also not suitable due to:
– The liability of the proprietor is unlimited and it can extend even to his personal assets. When the
proprietor incurs losses and business assets are not sufficient to meet the liabilities of business, his
personal assets can be used for discharging the business liabilities.
– The proprietor does not get deduction on account of remuneration payable to him for rendering of
services. It is felt that profits are the reward for contributing capital and taking risk and remuneration
must be given for the service rendered by the proprietor which should be allowed as deductible
expenditure. However, income-tax law does not allow the deduction of remuneration.
– Another drawback of this form of organization is that it does not provide opportunities to finance the
expanding business activities. In the case of a partnership firm, on the other hand, capital can be raised
by the existing partners or by admitting another partner.
(D) Hindu Undivided Family
A joint Hindu family pays tax on its total income at prescribed rates on the basis of slab system. The family can
pay reasonable remuneration to the Karta and other family members for their services to the business and it is
allowed as a deduction in computing the business income. However, interest on capital contributed by the family
for the business is not deductible in computing business income. The member of the family, who has received
the remuneration from the family will include it in his income under the head Salaries.
A Hindu undivided family will also get a basic exemption of ` 2,50,000 for assessment year 2017-18. Besides the
deductions which are allowed to other forms of organisatin, it is allowed certain deductions under Sections 80C,
80D, 80DD, 80DDB and 80GG like individuals. The tax rates in case of HUF are same as applicable to individual.
The demerits of HUF, however, are similar to that of individuals.

(c) LOCATIONAL ASPECTS
Tax planning is relevant from location point of view. There are certain locations which are given special tax
treatment. Some of these are as under:
1. Full exemption under Section 10A for ten years in the case of a newly established industrial undertaking
in free trade zones, etc. [Not allowed w.e.f. A.Y. 2012-13].
2. Full exemption under Section 10AA for initial five years, 50% for subsequent five years and further
deduction of 50% for a further period of five years in the case of a newly established units in special
economic zones on or after 1.4.2005.
3. Full exemption under Section 10B for 10 years in the case of a newly established 100% export-oriented
undertaking. [Not allowed w.e.f. 2012-13].
4. Deduction under Section 80-IAB in respect of profits and gains by an undertaking or an enterprise
engaged in the development of Special Economic Zone.
5. Deduction under Section 80-IB in the case of profits and gains from certain industrial undertaking other
than infrastructure development undertaking.
6. Deduction under Section 80-IC in case of certain undertaking or enterprises in certain special category
States.

604 EP-TL&P
7. Deduction under Section 80-ID in respect of profits and gains from business of hotels and convention
centres in specified area.
8. Deduction under Section 80-IE in respect of certain undertakings in North-Eastern States.

(d) NATURE OF BUSINESS
Tax planning is also relevant while deciding upon the nature of business. There are certain businesses which
are granted special tax treatment. Some of them are as follows:
– Newly established industrial undertaking in free trade zones, etc. [Section 10A]. [Not allowed w.e.f. A.Y.
2012-13].
– Newly established units in special economic zones [Section 10AA].
– Newly established hundred per cent export-oriented undertakings [Section 10B]. [Not allowed w.e.f.
A.Y. 2012-13].

(e) TAX PLANNING RELATING TO CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING
The following suggestions could be useful for tax planning in respect of amalgamation merger, demerger, etc.
1. Since the unabsorbed losses and unabsorbed depreciation cannot be allowed to be carried forward or
set off in the hands of the amalgamated company, except in the cases prescribed under Section 72A of
the Act, it is suggested:
(a) that the scheme of the amalgamation can be put off till such time the full benefit of set off is availed
of by the amalgamating company; and
(b) that the loss carrying company should absorb or take over the business of the profit-making company.
In other words, the profit making company should merge itself with the loss incurring company. This
would help in carrying forward the benefits of all unabsorbed losses and depreciation for set off
against the profits derived from the business of the profit-making company.
2. To save from disallowance of the debts of the amalgamating company which subsequently become bad
in the hands of the amalgamated company, the amalgamated company should plan to make suitable
provision for the expected losses on account of bad debts at the time of fixing the consideration while
taking over the business of the amalgamating company.
In view of the Court judgment of CIT v. T. Veerabhadra Rao (1985) 22 Taxmann 45, the bad debts are
not allowed to an assessee by way of personal relief but to a business. So, it is possible for the
amalgamated company to claim bad debts even in respect of debts taken over from the amalgamating
company.
3. A company whose shares are not quoted on a recognised stock exchange may avail the benefit of
amalgamation by amalgamating itself with another company whose shares are quoted on a recognised
stock exchange. This would help shareholders of unlisted company to take the advantage of the quoted
price of their shares in the stock exchange.
4. A company holding investments in immovable properties may avail the benefit of non-applicability of the
provisions of the Urban Land Ceiling Act by amalgamating itself with an industrial company.
5. A loss incurring company and a profit-making company may merge in order to reduce the overall incidence
of liabilities to tax under the Income Tax Act, 1961.
6. In case the conditions provided under Sections 2(1B) and 72A of the Act are not satisfied, it may be
suggested that the profit making company should merge itself with the loss making company, so that the
loss making company does not lose its existence and enjoys all other benefits.
7. Under Section 2(1B) of the Act, it is provided that for availing the benefits of amalgamation, at least 75%
of the shareholders of the amalgamating company should become shareholders of the amalgamated
company. In case more than 25% of the shareholders are not willing to become shareholders of the
amalgamated company, it is proposed that the amalgamating company may persuade the other
shareholders who may be willing, to purchase the shares in the amalgamated company to acquire the
shares of the remaining shareholders so that the percentage of dissenting shareholders does not exceed
25%. Alternatively, the amalgamated company prior to, amalgamation, may purchase shares from such

606 EP-TL&P
dissenting shareholders so as to make such dissenting shareholders to go below the specified percentage
of 25%.
There is a recent trend of going in for reverse merger. It means that the profit making company merges into the sick
company thereby becoming eligible to carry forward of losses etc. without the aid of Section 72A of the Act. The
profit making or healthy company extinct and loose its name and the surviving sick company retains its name. It is
actually device of bypassing merger under Section 72A of the Act and has become popular now a days.
Invariably soon after the merger or after a year or so, the name of the company is changed to accord with that of
the profit making amalgamating company in this way two birds are killed with one stone because : (1) Losses
are carried forward, which would otherwise have not been possible; (2) Goodwill, which consists, in the name of
the profit making amalgamating company, is also retained.
The same route was followed, among others, by Kirloskar Pneumatics Ltd. where the company merged with
Kirloskar Tractors Ltd., a sick unit and initially lost its name but after one year it changed its name as was prior
to merger. However, it remains to be seen whether the Parliament/Judiciary views this kind of strategy as an
exercise resulting in tax-avoidance or not? But, right now, this is not required in view of changes done in Section
2(1B) and 72A of the Act.

(f) TAX PLANNING RELATING TO FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS
When a company raises long term loans from financial institutions or by way of public issue of debentures or
inviting deposits from the public, it should plan that the expenses incurred on such issues of debentures or
expenses towards stamp duty, registration fees, and lawyer’s fees should be incurred only after the date of the
‘setting-up’ of the business. The interest on loan paid before the commencement of production but after setting
up of the business on the loans taken by the company for the acquisition of its plant and machinery and other
assets, forms part of the actual cost of the asset and it should be capitalized in actual cost of asset. Thus, the
company would be allowed to capitalise the expenditure and claim a higher depreciation and investment allowance.
The company should also plan the optimum use of the share capital and the borrowed funds. The borrowings
should be utilised as far as possible for the acquisition and installation of assets like, buildings, plant and machinery
so that interest could for the period after setting up of the acquired assets but before the commencement of
production could be capitalised. The interest and higher amount of depreciation (due to capitalisation of expense)
may be claimed as revenue expenditure pertaining to the business of the company.
The company should also plan to purchase the depreciable assets on credit terms and an agreed amount of
interest can be paid on such credit purchases or the company may purchase these company assets on the
basis of the hire purchase agreement enabling the company to claim the amount of interest paid as revenue
business expenditure. The company would also be entitled to claim either the depreciation for use of the asset
or may treat the hire charges as the rent for the asset in the normal course of business and claim deduction on
revenue account.
The following table will help the finance manager framing suitable plans relating to capital structure:
Capital

Borrowings

(a) Dividend/Interest

Not deductible

Fully deductible

(b) Cost of raising finance

1/5th allowed under Section 35D

Fully deductible in first year.

Taking the same sources of finance, the comparison between pre-commencement period and postcommencement period is as follows :
(a) (i) Dividend is not deductible either for pre-commencement period or in the post-commencement period in
India.

Lesson 13

Tax Planning & Tax Management

607

(ii) Interest is capitalised for pre-commencement period, i.e. added to the cost of project’ (cost of fixed
assets) and its depreciation is calculated on capitalised value of assets. In post-commencement period,
interest is fully deductible.
(b) (i) Cost of raising finance in case of capital is not deductible as revenue expenditure but amortised under
Section 35D of the Act. If such expenditure is incurred after the commencement of the business. Section
35D is applicable, provided the expenditure is undertaken for expansion purposes in case of industrial
undertaking.
(ii) Cost of borrowing funds in case of pre-commencement period is capitalised and in case of postcommencement period, it is deductible fully in the year.
The above consideration will go a long way in suggesting the managements of corporate entities to adopt a
suitable capital structure and selecting the appropriate financing sources by providing an optimum capital mix
for the organization

(g) TAX PLANNING RELATING TO NON-RESIDENTS
Suggested tax planning measures for Non-Resident are:
1. As a Non-resident is not required to pay tax on his income earned and received outside India, an Indian
citizen having an assignment abroad could plan his visits to India in such a way so that he could remain
to be a Non-Resident for the purpose of the Income Tax Act. This is generally of interest to persons
employed in foreign countries.
2. All those dealing with Non-Residents must keep in view the provisions of Sections 162 and 163. They
should retain sufficient amounts with them to be paid on behalf of the Non-Resident towards his tax
liability, so that they are not obliged to pay such taxes on their own account. They should also keep in
view the obligations casted by Section 200 which require paying of the taxes deducted within the time
prescribed so as to avoid applicability of the prosecution provisions under Section 276B.
3. A Non-resident must be very clear as regards his tax liability through agent. He must be aware that the
agent will deduct some amount out of the amount payable to the Non-Resident.
4. Persons employed by or on behalf of a Non-Resident, those who have a business connection with NonResident and statutory agents are all considered as authorised agents of a Non-Resident. Even a NonResident could be treated as the agent of another Non-Resident.
5. It should be remembered that if the agent is unable to recover the amount of tax paid on the behalf of
Non-Resident (from the Non-Resident) the same could not be claimed as a bad debt or business loss in
view of Supreme Court decision in CIT v. Abdullabhai Abdhulkadar (1961 41 ITR 545).
6. Another very important point is the close financial association between a resident and a Non-Resident.
This can also amount to a business connection. In a case where all Indian Banks and a foreign bank
were controlled by the same persons and the main function of the foreign bank was to finance the Indian
Bank, it was held that a business connection existed in India between the two banks, Bank of Chettinad
Ltd. v. CIT Madras (PC) (1940) 8 ITR 522.
7. When an individual, being a citizen of India leaves India for purposes of employment, the new explanation
under Section 6(1)(c) mitigates the rigor of the provisions about treating a person as resident and
ordinarily resident. Under clause (c), an individual is said to be resident in India in any previous year if
having been in India for at least 365 days during the four preceding years, he is in India for atleast 60
days in that year. Clause (a) of the new explanation provides that where an individual citizen leaves
India in any previous year as a member of the crew of an Indian ship as defined in clause (18) of Section
3 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 (44 of 1958); or for purpose of employment outside India, the
period of 60 days will be substituted by 182 days. Likewise, clause (b) provides that where an Indian
citizen or a person of Indian origin within the meaning of Explanation to Clause (e) of Section 115C who

608 EP-TL&P
is outside India comes on a visit to India in, the previous year, the period of 60 days referred to in subclause (c) will be substituted by 182 days. Thus, they will be Non-Resident in India for that year and as a
result salary income earned abroad will not be taxed in India. They may visit India during vacation for 181
days or less, or else if he desires to stay in India for a period longer than 181 days the visit should be so
planned over two previous years that his total stay in any one previous year should remain 181 days or
less.
In this way they can stay upto 362 days (181 days in one financial year and 181 days in another financial
year) at a stretch without becoming resident in any of the two previous years.
Explanation to Section 6(1)(c) had been substituted by Direct Tax Laws (Second Amendment) Act, 1989 and
subsequently amended by the Finance Act, 1990 with effect from 1.4.1990 i.e. for and from the assessment year
1990-91. Under the substituted Explanation, it is. provided that in the case of an Individual:
(a) being a citizen of India, who leaves India in any previous year as a member of the crew of an Indian ship
as defined under Section 3(18) of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 (44 of 1958, or for the purposes of
employment outside India, the provisions of Section 6(1)(c) shall apply in relation to that year as if for
the words ‘sixty days’, the words’ ‘one hundred and eighty two days’ had been substituted.
(b) being a citizen of India, or a person of Indian origin within the meaning of Explanation to Section 115C(e),
who being outside India, comes on a visit to India in any previous year, the provisions of Section 6(1)(c)
shall apply in relation to that year as if for the words ‘sixty days’ occurring therein, the words ‘one
hundred and eighty two days’ had been substituted.

(h) TAX PLANNING FOR INDIAN COLLABORATORS
While entering into an agreement for foreign collaboration, the Indian collaborator should take into consideration
such aspects as will enable him to plan his tax affairs in a manner that ensures maximum after-tax profits and
return on investment. In this context, the Indian collaborator may be advised to adopt the following steps for tax
planning:
(i) Capitalisation of installation expenses
As far as purchase of capital goods from the foreign collaborator is concerned, it is needless to say that this is
a capital expenditure on which depreciation is admissible. But care should be taken to see that the cost of
installation, including the supervision expenses charged by the collaborator, is also capitalised and depreciation
claimed thereon, The Indian company should also be vigilant that the other expenses relating to the collaboration
agreement must be incurred after the date of the setting up of the business, because only then it would be
entitled to be capitalised as other expenses.
(ii) Treating purchase of spares as revenue expenditure
For the purchase of spares for the plant, the Indian collaborator should plan to receive the spares subsequent to
the year of commissioning of the plant and preferably execute a separate contract in this behalf. It will enable the
Indian company to treat the whole of the amount incurred on spares as revenue expenditure. In this context, the
judgement of the Madras High Court in CIT v. Rama Sugar Mills Ltd. (1052) 21 ITR 191 (Mad.) is worth-noting.
A sugar manufacturing company had three boilers at its factories. Two of these were constantly in use and the
third one was kept as “spare” ready to be used when one of the other two boilers had to be cleaned up at
intervals. The productive capacity of one of the boilers deteriorated and the company was required to purchase
the other at a cost of ` 85,000. The Madras High Court held that this expenditure was deductible on revenue
account, on the ground that “the boiler which was substituted was exactly similar to the old one and by this
expenditure, the assessee company did not bring any additional advantage to the trade or business, which they
were carrying on and there is no improvement. It cannot be suggested that by using a new boiler for an old one,
the production capacity of the sugar manufacturing unit was in any manner increased”.

(iii) Treating plans and drawings, etc. as “Plant for availing of full value as depreciation
ln view of the Supreme Court’s decision in the case ClT v. Alps Theatre, (1067) 65 ITR T77 (S.C.) “Plant”
includes ships, vehicles, books, scientific apparatus, and surgical equipments used for the purpose of business
or profession.
However, know how acquired on or after 1.4.1998, owned wholly or partly by the assessee and used by such
assessee for the purpose of his business or profession, will form a separate block of asset alongwith other
intangible asset and will be eligible for depreciation under section 32(1) @ 25% on written down value.

(i) TAX PLANNING FOR EMPLOYEES
The employees should keep the following aspects in view while planning their salary package:
(i) The employee should opt for division of salary into basic pay and allowances and should not opt for the
consolidated salary. This will minimise his tax incidence considerably as some of the allowances are
exempt from tax upto a certain extent for e.g. conveyance allowance is exempt upto `1600 p.m.
(ii) Under the terms of employment, dearness allowance should form part of the retirement benefits. This
will not only increase the employees retirement benefits but also reduce his tax incidence in respect of
HRA, gratuity, commuted pension, employer's contribution to RPF, etc.
(iii) Any commission payable as per the terms of employment should be based on turnover so as to form
part of salary. This will also reduce the tax incidence in respect of HRA, commuted pension, interest
credited to RPF, etc.
(iv) If the employee is allowed the use of more than one car for his private purposes, the horse power of any
such car should not exceed 1.6 litre cubic capacity as otherwise he shall be deemed to have been
provided with one car of 1.6 cubic litre capacity which would lead to higher valuation of such perquisite.
(v) The employer's contribution to RPF should be 12% of salary as it is exempt upto this limit.
(vi) The employee should opt for re-imbursement of expenses on medical treatment (on free medical facility)
in place of medical allowance because such allowance is taxable whereas the reimbursement is not
taxable upto the extent of ` 15,000. The same thing holds good for entertainment allowance.
(vii) Perquisites should be preferred to taxable allowances. This shall help not only in lower valuation of a
perquisite like rent free house but the employee will also be free from falling into the category of specified
employees.
(viii) It may be noted that if furniture is provided without rent free accommodation, it will not be taxable in the
hands of non-specified employees.
(ix) An employee who resigns before completing five years of continuous service in an organisation, should
ensure that the new organisation he joins maintains RPF so that the accumulated balance of the provident
fund could be transferred to the new organisation to claim exemption thereon.
(x) On retirement, the employee should opt for commuted pension to the maximum permissible limit as it is
exempt from tax within certain limits.
(xi) Leave encashment should preferably be done on termination of employment by superannuation or
otherwise as it will then be exempt from tax within certain limits.
In addition to the above, the employees should also plan for taking full advantage of the relevant provisions
under Section 80C to 80U of the Income Tax Act.

ORGANISATION OF TAX PLANNING CELLS
Some companies can afford to have separate tax planning departments while others cannot. The need for

610 EP-TL&P
having tax planning department does not depend upon the amount of tax liability of the company. In fact, in
certain cases, companies having effective tax planning cells can plan their transactions with a view to attract the
least incidence of tax organisation of such a cell can be justified on the following grounds :
(a) Complexity and volume of work
Where the volume of tax work to be handled is large and highly complex, then it is required to appoint a special
tax expert along with the required staff.
(b) Separate Documentation
Documentation is an indispensable ingredient of tax planning. An assessee has to keep reliable, complete and
updated documentation for all the relevant tax files so that the documentary evidence can be made available at
a short notice whenever it is required. In absence thereof, an assessee may lose a case for want of proper
documentary evidence. The company has to maintain proper account books, records, vouchers, bills,
correspondence and agreements, etc. as a part of tax planning. In the case of new industrial undertaking it is
better to keep separate accounts for the same.
(c) Data Collection
The staff concerned with taxation has to collect and keep on collecting data relating to latest circulars, case
laws, rules and provisions, and other government notifications to keep abreast of the current developments.
This could also guide them in any particular area, when such guidance is needed. The composition of organisation
of such data bank may vary from one organisation to another. However, keeping in view the general areas of
operation of the company, it may, be advisable to arrange the data in the order of subject sequence. This would
enable easy availability of information at the relevant time.
(d) Integration
Tax planner should be consulted by all the departments of the company to know the impact of taxation on their
decisions. It would be necessary to integrate and properly link all the departments of the company with the tax
planning department. Any project or blue print may have a tax angle. This has to be identified early enough to
facilitate better tax compliance and availing of the several incentives. The department has to deal with all taxes
(State, Central and Local Self Governments).
(e) Constant Monitoring
In order to obtain the intended tax benefits, persons connected with tax management should ensure compliance
of all the pre-requisites, like procedures, rules etc. Besides, there should be constant monitoring, so that all the
tax obligations are discharged and penal consequences avoided.
(f) Developing Tax effective Alternatives
A managerial decision could be assumed to have been well taken only if all the pros and cons are considered.
A tax planner could guide important decisions, by considering varieties of alternatives and choices.
(g) Take advantage of variance allowances and deductions
A tax manager has to keep track of the provisions relating to various allowances, deductions, exemptions, and
rebates so as to initiate tax planning measures. The details of various tax incentives have been duly dealt with
in the relevant studies in this book.

OVERALL TAX PLANNING MEASURES
1. Apart from location and nature of business, form of organisation is another important area where tax planning
with reference to setting up a new business could be exercised. It is discussed that, company form of organisation
is to be preferred from long-term point of view. There are, however, certain other dimensions in this context. One
such dimension is the preference for a widely held company as against a closely held company so much that we

Lesson 13

Tax Planning & Tax Management

611

would suggest conversion of an existing closely held company into a widely held company because a widely
held company would be able to enjoy the following tax benefits over a closely held company.
(a) Widely-held companies do not find limitations and restrictions in the matter of set off and carry forward
of losses whereas closely-held companies have certain limitations or restrictions in this respect under
the provisions of Section 79 of the Act. In the case of companies in which the public are not substantially
interested, losses will not be carried forward and set off unless: the shares of the company carrying not,
less than 51 per cent of the voting power were beneficially held by the same person(s) both on the last
day of the previous year in which loss occurred and on the last day of the previous year in which brought
forward loss is sought to be set off.
However, if a change in voting power as aforesaid takes place consequent upon the death of a shareholder
or on account of transfer of shares by way of gift to any relative of the shareholder making such gift, then
the aforesaid disability does not get attracted. This disability is also not attracted where change in the
shareholding of an Indian company which is a subsidiary of a foreign company, take place as a result of
amalgamation or demerger of a foreign company subject to the condition that fifty one percent
shareholders of the amalgamating or demerged foreign company continue to be the shareholders of the
amalgamated or the resulting foreign company.
The provisions of Section 79 of the Act are applicable in the case of carry forward and set-off of losses
only. As carry forward of unabsorbed depreciation allowance, investment allowance, development rebates
and development allowance stands on an altogether different footing; their carry forward and set off is
not governed by Section 79 of the Act in view of the decision of Madras High Court in CIT v. Concord
Industries Ltd. (1979) 119 ITR 458 (Madras).
The Madras High Court’s decision was later followed by the Kerala High Court in Commissioner of
Income Tax v. Kalpaka Enterprises (P) Ltd. 986, 157 ITR 658 holding that Section 79 of the Income Tax
Act, 1961 overrides the other provisions in Chapter VI and not the other provisions in the Act itself as is
clear from the opening words ‘Notwithstanding anything contained in this Chapter’. The connotation of
the expression ‘loss’ occurring in Section 79 has thus to be understood in the context of the provisions
contained in Chapter VI itself. The ‘loss’ mentioned in Section 79 is relatable to the ‘loss’ specifically
provided for in the other provisions of the said Chapter. It is in respect of losses which could be carried
forward and set off under the said Chapter that Section 79 operates to limit that set off only to the
previous year in question without extending it to any prior years. The Act does not treat or describe
‘unabsorbed depreciation’ or 'unabsorbed development rebate’ as losses and these items cannot be
treated as losses for purposes of Section 79. Hence, the bar imposed under Section 79 does not apply
to 'unabsorbed depreciation’ or ‘unabsorbed development rebate’.
In this case, while finalising the assessment for the year 1969-70, the Income-tax Officer, after adjusting
the losses brought forward from the preceding three years, determined the total income, as nil and also
recorded inter alia, that unabsorbed depreciation for the prior years 1964-65 should be carried forward.
The order of the income-tax Officer was set aside by the Commissioner in view of the fact that the officer
had allowed set-off of the earlier year’s losses against the profits of the year without considering the
question of the applicability of Section 79 of the Act. The Tribunal, however, held that Section 79 of the
Act did not apply to the unabsorbed depreciation and development rebate. On a reference to the High
Court, the Court held that the Tribunal was right in holding that the provisions of Section 79 of the Act
prohibiting the carry forward of losses in certain Companies would not apply to unabsorbed depreciation
and development rebate.
(b) The provisions of ‘deemed dividend’ in respect of advances or loans to shareholders, or any payment
on behalf of shareholders or any payment for the individual benefit of a shareholder are applicable to
closely held companies under Section 2(22)(e) of the Act.

612 EP-TL&P
(c) The conversion would not be treated as transfer of ownership of the business and hence, there shall be
no liability for capital-gains tax or Income tax in the hands of the closely-held company or the new
widely-held company, due to conversion.
2. Separate Accounts: It is advisable, though not a statutory obligation, to keep the accounts of the new business
separate. This obviates the necessity of making any estimates, complicating the state of affairs of the
new business. In this connection, reference may be made to CIT v. Dunlop Rubber Co. (I) Ltd., 1977 (107 ITR
182).
In this case, the existing company established a new factory and no separate accounts were maintained by the
new unit. But, as a matter of fact, this was not essential for claiming the benefit. In this case the assessee
claimed the benefit on the proportion of turnover between the new unit and old unit. Was the method adopted
correct? The duty of Revenue Department was to determine the exemption allowed by law.
It was held : “it was the duty of the I.T.O. under Sections 143 to 145 of the Act, to determine the total income of
the assessee and determine the tax payable, even if the income could not be derived from the books of the
assessee. So, Income-tax Officer cannot deny the relief. Difficulty in computing the relief cannot be a ground for
rejecting the claim. A rule of apportionment consistent with commercial accounting must be evolved in computing
the income. If the assessee already followed certain system, which is in vogue in general, from a commercial
accounting angle, and if the Income-tax Officer disputes such system he should correct it and cannot reject it as
whole-sum. In this case it was held that the Income-tax Officer could not refuse the claim for exemption.
Supreme Court in Textile Machinery Corporation Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1977 108 ITR 195) interalia, held that the fact that there was common management or the fact that separate accounts had not been
maintained, would not lead to the conclusion that they were not separate undertakings. Even if separate account
is not maintained, the investment in each of the units can be reasonably determined with the material which the
assessee may make available to the department. The test is whether it is a new and identifiable undertaking
separate and distinct from the existing business. It is sufficient if the new undertaking is an integrated unit by
itself wherein articles are produced and a minimum of 10 persons are employed. In Mahindra Sintered Products
Ltd. (1989, 177, ITR 111), the Bombay High Court held that it was not necessary that separate accounts had to
be maintained but separate accounts kept in the ledger are sufficient to claim deduction under Section 80J.
Following the ratio laid down by the Bombay High Court in the case of Mahindra Sintered Products Ltd. (supra)
the Patna High Court held that the in order to claim special deduction under Section 80J, the following facts have
to be established by the assessee namely:
(i) investment of substantial fresh capital in the new industrial undertaking set up,
(ii) employment of requisite labour therein,
(iii) manufacture or production of articles on the said undertaking,
(iv) earning of profits clearly attributable to the said undertaking, and
(v) above all, a separate and distinct identity of the industrial unit set up.
The fact that there was common management or the fact that the separate accounts had not been maintained or
that there was a common source of power would not mean that it was not a new undertaking. The assessee was
held entitled for relief under Section 80J.
Following its judgement in the case of Mahindra Sintered Products Ltd. (supra) the Bombay High Court held in
Commissioner of Income-tax v. Mazaggon Dock Ltd. (1991, 191 ITR 461) that the maintenance of separate
accounts is not a condition precedent for claiming special deduction under Section 80J. Since the frigate project
was a new one and the capital outlay was many times more than the assessee’s capital, the assessee was
entitled to deduction under Section 80J.
Though Section 80J is omitted with effect from 1.4.89, the ratio is applicable on other deduction available.

Lesson 13

613

3. Avoid interconnection of service or departmental centralisation or pooling of resources of the new business
and any other activity of the assessee. In this connection, a reference may be made to T. Satish U. Pai v. CIT 119
ITR 877 (Kar).
4. Avoid, transfer of goods between the new business and the assessee’s other activities and encourage only
cash flows out of sale proceeds towards investment or capital purpose.
5. It is better for the new business to have separate floor area, separate licenses and agreements, if it is not related
to the assessee at all. Even separate profit computation should be encouraged. But the total income should be
computed as per the scheme of the Act. [CIT v. Kashmir Fruit and Chemical Industries, 1975 98 ITR 311 (J & K)].
6. In case of capital intensive industries having long gestation periods; generally profit earning would be delayed.
This is true even in the case of complicated and time-consuming manufacturing processes. In such circumstances,
it is quite likely that only 'deficiency’ would be absorbed.
7. Each industrial unit (for example, weaving and spinning units in case of textile business) of an industrial
organisation has to be considered for computing the tax holiday benefit.
8. Any capital or revenue expenditure incurred towards scientific research under Section 35, will be treated as
mentioned therein.

LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENTS
It is a common feature of modern legislative system to lay down in the Acts, the principles and the policy of the
legislature leaving out details to be filled-in or worked-out by rules or regulations made either by the Government
or by some other authority as may be empowered in the legislations. This kind of subordinate or administrative
legislation is justified and even necessitated by the fact that the legislature has neither the time nor the material
to consider and act with reference to various details. Not only that they may not be even acquainted fully with the
facts and circumstances relating to the subject matter. Section 295(4) of the Income-tax Act and vest in the
Central Board of Direct Taxes the power to give retrospective effect to any of the rules in such a way as not to
prejudicially affect the interest of the tax payers.
The various matters in respect of which the rules may be framed are specified in the relevant sections. Section
119 read together with Section 295 empowers Central Board for Direct Taxes to frame rules, issue circulars,
notifications, administrative instructions to the sub-ordinate authority for smooth functioning of the Income Tax
Act, 1961. Section 119 read together with Section 295 gives general powers to Central Board for Direct Taxes to
frame the rules and notifications. However, relevant sections empower Central Board for Direct Taxes to frames
rules and issue relevant notifications. For example, Section 44AA provides that certain persons carrying on
profession or business such as legal, medical, architectural or interior decoration or the profession of accountancy
or technical consultancy or any other profession as is notified by the Board. Therefore, on careful perusal of
Section 44AA, it may be seen that this Section empowers Central Board for Direct Taxes to issue notification to
the effect that other professions shall be covered by the provision of Section 44AA for maintenance of books of
account.

STATUTORY FORCE OF THE NOTIFICATIONS
Section 296 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 provides that the Central Government shall cause every rule made
under this Act or for that matter any notification issued, to place before both the Houses of Parliament either
before issuing them or in case same is issued when Parliament is not in session immediately thereafter when
the Houses are in session. Rules and notifications are made by the appropriate authority in exercise of the
power conferred on it under the provisions of the Act. For the A.Y. 2008-09, notification includes every notification
issued before the 1-6-07 under Section 10(23C)(iv). Therefore, they have statutory force and can be equated to
the law made by the legislature itself. Thus, they are a part and parcel of the enactment. The rules cannot,
however, take away what is expressly conferred by the Act. In other words, they cannot whittle down the effect

614 EP-TL&P
of the law. The rules are only made in consonance with provisions of the Act. They must be interpreted in the
light of the section under which they are made. If there is any irreconcilable conflict between a rule and a
provision in the Act, the provision in the Act will prevail.
Notifications when validly made in exercise of the authority provided for in the law, are equally binding on all
concerned and may be enforced. (As for press notes, although they have no statutory force as such, they are
binding on the officers). Section 119(1) of the Income-tax Act provides that all officers and other persons employed
in the execution of the said Act shall observe and follow the orders, instructions and directions of the Board,
provided that such orders, instructions or directions shall be issued as not to interfere with the discretion of the
Appellate Assistant Commissioner in the exercise of his appellate functions.
It is judicially settled that the circulars issued by the Board would be binding under Section 119 on all the officers
and persons employed in the execution of the Act [Navnital Javeri v. Sen (1965) 56 ITR 198 (SC)]. If an Income
Tax Officer contravenes any circular issued by the CBDT in any respect, he can be called-upon by the appropriate
authority including the Commissioner/Commissioner (Appeals), and the Appellate Tribunal to give effect to it.
Though the Circular is not the same footing as a rule, it can be taken judicial note of. However, it may be noted
that an opinion expressed by the Board in individual communications to the assessee (for example, as to when
the new industrial undertaking established by the assessee began to manufacture or produce articles within the
meaning of Section 80(I) cannot be considered as directions binding on the income tax authorities under Section
119. The Board is not competent to give directions where the exercise of any quasi judicial discretion by the
subordinate authorities in individual cases is involved. [J.K. Synthetics Ltd. v. CBDT (1972) 83 ITR 335 (SC)]. It
has been clarified by the Supreme Court in Kerala Financial Corporation v. CIT 210 ITR 129 that Section 119
does not empower the CBDT to issue order, instruction or direction overriding the provisions of the Act. That
would be destructive of all known principles of law as the same would really amount to giving power to a
delegated authority to even amend the provisions of law enacted by the Parliament. Under Section 119 CBDT
also cannot issue order for a specific case.
Normally, exemptions should be specifically provided by the Statute giving exemptions. Where schedules and
notifications are issued as empowered by the statute, the exemptions given by the notification would be legally
valid as if were given by the statute itself. In the case of Collector of Central Excise v. Parle Exports (P) Ltd.
(1990, 183 ITR 624), the Supreme Court had held that when a notification is issued in accordance with powers
conferred by the statute, it has statutory force and validity and therefore, it is as if the exemptions under the
notification were contained in the Act itself.
The various judicial rulings point out the following:
(1) The instructions of the Board are binding on the Department but not on the assessee.
(2) The instructions have to be followed by the Departmental Officers. Instruction adverse to an assessee’s
interest can be challenged by him.
(3) The instructions withdrawn subsequently should be given effect to by the Assessing Officer for the
assessment year for which they were in force even though they are withdrawn at the time he makes
the assessment.
(4) In the exercise of its power, the Board cannot impose a burden or put the assessee in a worse position.
In view of this position, the tax planner, while planning his affairs or that of his clients must take into account not
only the relevant legal provisions which affect him but also all relevant rules, notifications, circulars etc. As for
circulars, since they are in the nature of administrative or executive instructions, the possibility that they might
be withdrawn by the Board at any time, should also be taken into account. They may be challenged in the courts
although, otherwise, they are binding at the administrative level. In cases where the circulars are based on an
erroneous or untenable footing, they are liable to be quashed by the courts.

activity from A.Y. 17-18.
• Section 80IB (production of mineral oil and natural gas) – No deduction to enterprise which commences
the business activity from A.Y. 17-18.
• Section 32 (Depreciation) – Highest rate of depreciation shall be restricted to 40% from A.Y. 17-18
• Deduction u/s 35/3(2AA)/35(2AB)/35AD/35CCC – Weighted deduction will be phased out so that it will
not be available from A.Y. 2020-21

LESSON ROUND UP
– Tax Planning may be legitimate provided it is within the framework of the law. Colorable devices
cannot be part of tax planning and it is wrong to encourage or entertain the belief that it is honorable to
avoid payment of tax by resorting to dubious methods.
– Tax planning is an honest and rightful approach to the attainment of maximum benefits of the taxation
laws within their framework.
– The basic objectives of tax planning are: (a) Reduction of tax liability (b) Minimisation of litigation (c)
Productive investment (d) Healthy growth of economy (e) Economic stability.
– “Tax Avoidance” will be used to describe every attempt by legal means to prevent or reduce tax liability
which would otherwise be incurred by taking advantage of some provisions or lack of provisions of
law. It excludes fraud, concealment or other illegal measures.
– Tax evasion is a method of evading tax liability by dishonest means like suppression, showing lower
incomes, conscious violation of rules, inflation of expenses etc.

LESSON OUTLINE

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

– Basic Concepts

– What is arm’s length price?

After the liberalization of Indian economy and
easing of restrictions on the entry of foreign
entities, cross border business transactions have
increased manifold. With the ratification of WTO
by the Government of India, our economy has
become robust and an atmosphere has sprung
up where FII investments in India have increased
tremendously. All these economic activities have
ramifications for tax laws of the country. Issues
like tax havens, transfer pricing, double taxation,
WTO, Subpart F, etc. are required to be taken
care of and have become part and parcel of
international taxation regime. To overcome
difficulties faced by investors from different
countries, India in recent years entered into
Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA)
with many countries.

AN OVERVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL TAX PROVISIONS – FROM INDIAN PERSPECTIVE
After the liberalization of Indian economy and easing of restrictions on the entry of foreign entities, cross border
business transactions have increased manifold. With the ratification of WTO by the Government of India, our
economy has become robust and an atmosphere has sprang up where FII investments in India have increased
tremendously. All these economic activities has ramifications for tax laws of the country. Issues like tax havens,
transfer pricing, double taxation, WTO, Subpart F, etc. are required to be taken care of and have become part
and parcel of international taxation regime.
With the acceptance of the WTO regime India has embarked on the policy of market reforms and merging with
the international business community by providing market access to the overseas investor with nil or qualitatively
less restrictions.
In the context of international taxations, including cross border-investments, eliminated double taxation become
an important consideration in doing business in India and abroad specially with the double taxation aspect
became omnipresent in relations to transactions involving cross border investments with those foreign entities
belonging to those countries with which India doesn’t have double taxation avoidance agreements.
To overcome difficulties faced by investors from different countries, India in recent years entered into Double
Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA) with many countries. Section 91 of the Income Tax Act deals with
unilateral relief given to the concerned persons of the countries with whom India does not have DTAA. DTAA
under section 90 of the Act deals with general aspect concerning bilateral relief, multinational treaties and nontax treaties. Our domestic statute namely, Income Tax Act, 1961 in the year 2001, introduced in the Income Tax
Act elaborate legislation in Chapter X concerning transferring pricing (to be discussed later).
Another way of resolving disputes relating to taxes involving international transactions is through Mutual Agreement
Procedure (MAP) in regard to those categories of disputes where there are no DTAA through OECD models and
UN models regarding double tax avoidance agreements (the details of which are explained later). In order to
reduce the misuse of tax havens, some countries have started the concept of CFC (controlled foreign corporations)
to deal with the problems of tax evasion. There are nil tax haven destinations as well as low tax haven destinations.
The Income Tax Act, 1961 contains provisions to take care of transactions having extra-jurisdictional ramifications.
Such as some incomes earned abroad by resident tax payers or income earned in India by NRI’s and foreigners
which generally are taxable in India under certain conditions. In the former case, incomes are taxed as per
‘worldwide income’ principle, whereas in the latter case it is done through ‘source principle’.
OECD-MC [Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development–Model Convention] defines double
taxation as, “the imposition of comparable taxes in two (or more) states on the same tax payer in respect of the
same subject matter and for identical periods”.
In cases of double taxation the parties can get relief either through unilateral measures or bilateral measures or
under adjudication by judiciary or through commercial arbitration.
Section 90 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 deals with agreements entered by Government of India with Government
of other countries. Section 91 deals with provisions relating to those issues for which India does not have any
formal agreements with Government of other countries, regarding avoidance of double taxation. Section 90A
releases to granting of permissions to ‘specified association’ through Official Gazette notification to enter into
agreement with foreign governments in regard to giving of relief for double taxation.

TAX HAVEN
A Tax Haven is a place where there is no tax on income or it is taxed at low rate. Individuals or corporate entities
move from jurisdiction of high rates of taxes to the region of low tax in order to lower their overall tax liability. This
has created competition amongst various governments of the world to lure more investments from abroad.
Specially small countries are taking this opportunity to attract more investments from abroad. Many states have
adopted different tax structures for different customers. It is like making ‘tax haven shopping’ available to large
multinationals. This policy of the transnational corporate adversely affects the tax base of the country from
where such entities transfer their business. It is a process adopted generally by large to medium sized
multinationals to outmaneuver to pay lower taxes than those that would have been normally payable. Some
critics call it as a method of tax avoidance. The modern concept of tax haven was started about 20 years ago by
changing the focus from legislation to corporate vehicles which became pioneers in this field and are usually
charged under local taxation (although they usually do not trade locally).
These vehicles are usually called ‘exempt companies’ or ‘International Business Corporations’. But in last ten
years due to pressure from OECD, the tax haven countries have adjusted their domestic laws partially to check
tax avoidance and tax evasion practices.

Determining Factors of Tax Haven
The factors to be considered in taking decision whether a country is tax haven or not are:
1. Nil or Nominal tax Rate: There is no or nominal tax on income (generally or in specified circumstances.
2. No Exchange of Information: There is no system of exchange of information with respect to the tax
regime in the tax haven country.
3. Lack of Transparency: The regime lacks transparency
4. Limited Regulatory supervision: No proper regulatory supervision and lack of financial disclosures to
the government would also categories a country as Tax Haven.
5. The Government of the country facilitates the establishment of the foreign owned enterprises without
the need for strict compliance of local laws or prohibits such entities from having any mechanical impact
on the local economy.
The OECD has outlined three parameters to consider whether a jurisdiction is tax haven or not.
(a) Rate of tax applicable
(b) Withholding personal financial information.
(c) Lack of transparency.

622 EP-TL&P
Doing business through tax haven countries may not always be profitable. Some tax havens have become
failure adventures or misadventures, like Beirut, Tangiers, Liberia, etc.

Methodology
The modus operandi followed in doing business through tax havens broadly, are as under :
(a) Personal Residency: Where wealthy individuals reallocate themselves from high tax zones to low tax
zones.
(b) Asset Holding: It involves utilizing a trust or a company or a trust owing a company. Usually in this case,
an entity from high tax jurisdiction transfers its assets to a trust in a low tax jurisdiction and settles his
share in the trust on himself and later to his descendents without going through the vagaries of probate
or inheritance tax.
(c) Business Activity: Many corporate entities do not require locational or factor leverage to establish their
business entities. Simply by transferring activities to low tax jurisdiction, they can earn ‘margin’ even
though they are not performing any financial activity. They change their tax jurisdictions and through
‘rein voicing’ process they earn profit via investment in high tax jurisdictions. Example: Reinsurance
companies.
(d) Financial Intermediaries : Majority of business activities done in tax havens is through professional
financial services such as mutual funds, banking, life insurance ‘and pensions. Generally, the funds are
deposited with the intermediary in the low tax jurisdiction and intermediary then on-lends or invests the
money. Such systems do not normally avoid tax in the principle’s customer jurisdiction; it enables financial
service providers to provide multi-jurisdictional products without adding an additional layer of taxation.
This has proved particularly useful in area of offshore funds.
Worldwide income of the Indian Resident’s is taxable in India though section 91 of the Act provides relief by way
of credit in respect of the tax paid on their foreign income if, the source is in the country with which there is no
DTAA. Non-residents however are subject to source based taxation.
Some important destinations of tax havens are :
In USA – Delaware, Nevada, Wyoming, etc.
In Europe – Andorra, Canary, Lands, The Netherlands, Cyprus etc.
In Asia - Mauritius, Singapore, Dubai, etc.
In Africa : Capetown, Nairobi, etc.

Action taken to avoid harmful tax practices
OECD in May 1998 issued a report on Harmful Tax Competition and has made nineteen specific recommendations.
Some of these are:
1. Adopt Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) or equivalent rules.
2. Consider Foreign Information Reporting rules.
3. Enter into Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA).
4. Apply the provisions of withholding tax when payments are made to offshore recipients.
5. Curbing treaty shopping term nation of existing treaties with tax havens like Mauritius.
6. Mutual assistance of tax authorities in the recovery of cross border tax claims etc.
7. More international co-operation by establishing forums to avoid harmful tax practice etc.

CONTROLLED FOREIGN CORPORATION (CFC)
The OECD recommended for adoption of CFCs Rules for taxing those entities which defer the tax liability after
moving to the tax haven country. A CFC is a legal entity that exists in one jurisdiction but is owned or controlled
primarily by taxpayers of a different jurisdiction. The CFC rules may also be termed as ‘anti-deferral rules'.
Income from a foreign source is taxed usually after it is accrued or received as income in the country of residence
of the taxpayer. The use of intermediary entities in a tax-free or low-tax jurisdiction enables a tax resident to
defer (or avoid) the domestic tax on the income until it is repatriated to the residence state.
This tax deferral could lead to an unjustifiable loss to the domestic tax revenue. As countries increasingly ease
their exchange control rules, some have enacted Controlled Foreign Corporation rules to prevent the use of lowtax jurisdictions by their tax residents to defer the taxability of foreign income. Under the CFC rules, the domestic
law effectively extends the residence rules to tax the income. It requires that the tax on profits, whether distributed
or not, be paid by resident tax-payers. Normally, the CFC rules apply only to foreign companies controlled by
residents, but certain countries extend it to foreign permanent establishments and trusts.
Many years ago, in the US, the incomes of foreign corporations were not taxed unless it was derived from US
sources. In 1962, new tax laws were enacted to deter the use of foreign corporations as a way to avoid taxes.
These rules have evolved into the complex rules referred to as the "controlled foreign corporation" rules.
CFCs are a legal consortium of the tax authorities around the world. If income is taxed at some point of time,
then the taxpayer will have a greater after-tax retention of income if tax is paid during a future year as opposed
to being paid in the present year. An anti-deferral tax regime could compel the foreign company to repatriate the
profits, thus resulting in a favorable impact on the foreign exchange inflows as well as shoring up the domestic
tax base.
The U.S, the UK, Germany and 25 other countries have adopted CFC regulations. Generally, the CFC regime is
enacted by states in which tax liability is imposed on the worldwide income of resident taxpayers. Two operative
factors are key to worldwide tax liability and to the generation of tax revenues on foreign source income, that is,
the nexus between the state and the taxpayer; and the nexus between the taxpayer and the foreign income, the
latter being more important vis-à-vis CFC.
Indian corporate not only scaled up the size of their overseas acquisitions but in several instances bought out
companies much larger than them. The time now seems to be right to re-look the Controlled Foreign Corporation
(CFC) recommendations of the Kelkar Working Committee Report on Tax Reforms in India.

SUB PART F
Sub Part F means special category of foreign source unearned income that is currently taxed by the Internal
Revenue Code, 1986 of US whether or not it is remitted to the U.S. It is basically U.S. financial term used for the
U.S. based institutions.
According to definition given under section 952 of the US Code by Legal Information Institute (Cornell University
Law School), Sub Part F in “General” means in case of any foreign corporation, sum of :
(1) insurance income (as defined under section 953),
(2) the foreign base company income (as determined under section 954),
(3) an amount equal to the product of–
(A) the income of such corporation other than income which–
(i) is attributable to earnings and profits of the foreign corporation included in the gross income of
a United States person under section 951 (other than by reason of this paragraph), multiplied
by

624 EP-TL&P
(B) the international boycott factor (as determined under section 999),
(4) the sum of the amounts of any illegal bribes, kickbacks, or other payments (within the meaning of
section 162 (c)) paid by or on behalf of the corporation during the taxable year of the corporation directly
or indirectly to an official, employee, or agent in fact of a government, and
(5) the income of such corporation derived from any foreign country during any period during which section
901 (j) applies to such foreign country.
The payments referred to in paragraph (4) are payments which would be unlawful under the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977 if the payor were a United States person. For purposes of paragraph (5), the income
described therein shall be reduced, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, so as to take into account
deductions (including taxes) properly allocable to such income.
Sub Part F was enacted in U.S., in 1962, through it has been amended many times but it retained its basic
structure.
Sub Part F applies to certain income of “Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFC’s)”. CFC is a foreign corporation
more than 50% of which by vote or value is owned by U.S. persons including U.S. citizens owing a 10% or
greater interest in the corporation by VOTE (U.S. Shareholders). ‘U.S. persons’ includes U.S. citizens, residents,
corporations, partnerships, trusts and estates. If a CFC has Sub Part F income, each U.S. shareholder must
currently include prorates share of that income in its gross income as a deemed dividend.
Sub Part F rates attempt to prevent (or negate the tax advantage from) deflection of income, either from the
United States or from the foreign country in which earned, into another jurisdiction which is a tax haven or which
has a preferential tax regime for certain types of income. Thus, Sub Part F generally targets passive income and
income that is split off from the activities that produced the value in the goods or services generating the income.
Conversely Sub Part F does not require current taxation of active business income except when the income of
a type that is easily reflected to tax haven, such as shipping income except when the income type earned in
certain transaction of related parties. In related party transactions, deflections of is much easier because a
unified group of corporations can direct the flow of income between entities in different jurisdictions.
A major category of Sub Part F income is Foreign Personal Holding Company Income (FPACI). This category
includes interest, dividend, events and royalties. It also includes gains from the sale of property that produces
passive income or that it is held for investment, gains from commodity transaction and gains from foreign company
transactions as well as certain other income that is, in effect, the equivalent of interest or dividends. Because of
its passive nature, such income often is highly mobile and can be easily deflected.
Income from the sale of the goods manufactured by the selling CFC is excluded from the FBSCI Rules. This
exception is provided because, when the CFC performs the manufacturing generally, sales function has not
been separated from manufacturing function. However, because branches established in a separate jurisdiction
can facilitate the deflection of income, the FBCSI provision contain a branch rule that treats income from the sale
of goods manufactured by the CFC as FBCSI in certain cases when the selling and manufacturing, operation
have been separated into different tax jurisdictions to obtain a lower rate of tax for the sale income.
Foreign base company services income is another category of Sub Part F income that applies to active income
that can be deflected to a low tax jurisdictions through related party transactions, in this case, through the
performance of Services FBCSI includes income from services performed outside the CFC’s country of
incorporation for or on behalf of related person. These rules are generally to address circulation in which service
activities are separated from other business activities of a compensation into a separate subsidiary located in
another jurisdiction to obtain a lower rate of tax for the services income.
This result can occur not only when the CFC perform the services for an unrelated person. Thus, the regulations
contain ‘a substantial assistance’ rate under which if a related person provides the CFC with substantial assistance
contributing to the performance of the services will be treated as performed for on behalf of a related person.

MEANING OF THE TERM ‘RESIDENT OF CONTRACTING STATE’
Residence as defined in double taxation treaties is different from residence as defined for domestic tax purposes.
Tax treaties generally follow the OECD Model Convention which provides:
For the purposes of this Convention, the term ‘Resident of a Contracting State’ means any person who, under
the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, (UNMC also; place of
incorporation), place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and
any political sub-division or local authority thereof. This term, however, does not include any person who is liable
to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State or Capital situated therein.
Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then his
status shall be determined as follows:
(a) he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which he has a permanent home available to
him; if he has a permanent home available to him in both States, he shall be deemed to be a resident
only of the State with which his personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests);
(b) if the State in which he has his centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if he has not a permanent
home available to him in either State, he shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which he
has an habitual abode;
(c) if he has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, he shall be deemed to be a resident only
of the State of which he is a national;
(d) if he is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States
shall settle the question by mutual agreement.
Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting
States, then it shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which its place of effective management is
situated.

DOUBLE TAXATION RELIEF
The situation of double taxation will arise where the income gets taxed in two or more than two countries
whether due to residency or source principle as the case may be. The problem of double taxation arises if the
income of a person is taxed in one country on the basis of residence and on the basis of residency in another
country or on the basis of both. To mitigate the double taxation of income the provisions of double taxation relief
were made. The double taxation relief is available in two ways one is unilateral relief and other is bilateral relief.
Government of India can enter into agreement with a foreign government vide Entry 14 of the Union List regarding
any matter provided Parliament verifies it. Double Tax Avoidance Agreement is a kind of bilateral treaty or
agreement, between Government of India and any other foreign country or specified territory outside India.
Such treaty or agreement is permissible in terms of Article 253 of the Constitution of India.

(a) Section 90: Agreements with Foreign Countries or specified territories
India has entered into bilateral agreements with many countries regarding avoidance of double taxation including
tax avoidance and tax evasion issues.
Section 90 of the Income Tax Act 1961 deals with relief granted to assesses involved in paying taxes twice that
is, paying taxes in India as well as in Foreign Countries or specified territory outside India.

626 EP-TL&P
As per section 90, the Central Government may enter into an agreement with the Government of any country
outside India or specified territory outside India:
(a) for granting relief in respect of:(i) income on which tax have been paid both under Income Tax Act,1961 and Income-Tax Act prevailed
in that country or specified territory or
(ii) income-tax chargeable under Income Tax Act, 1961 and under the corresponding law in force in
that country or specified territory to promote mutual economic relations, trade and investment, or
(b) for the avoidance of double taxation of income under Income Tax Act, 1961 and under the corresponding
law in force in that country or specified territory, or
(c) for exchange of information for the prevention of evasion or avoidance of income-tax chargeable under
Income Tax Act, 1961 or under the corresponding law in force in that country or specified territory, or
investigation of cases of such evasion or avoidance, or
(d) for recovery of income-tax under Income Tax Act, 1961 and under the corresponding law in force in that
country or specified territory
Where the Central Government has entered into an agreement with the Government of any country outside
India or specified territory outside India for granting relief of tax, avoidance of double taxation, then, the provisions
of Income Tax Act, 1961 shall apply to the assessee to whom such agreement applies, to the extent they are
more beneficial to him. However, the provisions of Chapter X-A of the Act shall apply to the assessee even if
such provisions are not beneficial to him. The assessee shall have a certificate of his being a resident.
All relief’s announced by the Union Government are through Official Gazette. It has been stated in the provision
that charge of tax in respect of a foreign company at a higher rate than the rate at which a domestic company is
chargeable shall not be regarded as less favourable charge or levy of tax in respect of such foreign company.
The benefit of double taxation agreement or tax treaty shall be applicable only when a tax residency certificate
is obtained of his residence in any country outside India or specified territory outside India from the Government
of that country or specified territory.

(b) Section 90A : Agreements between Specified Associations for double taxation relief
The Central Government is empowered by section 90A to enter into an agreement with any specified association
in the specified territory outside India and the Central Government has been authorized to make such provisions
as may be necessary for adopting and implementing such agreement. The provisions may be made:
(a) for granting relief in respect of
(i) income on which tax have been paid both under Income Tax Act, 1961 and Income-Tax Act prevailed
in that specified territory; outside India; or
(ii) income-tax chargeable under Income Tax Act, 1961 and under the corresponding law in force in
that specified territory to promote mutual economic relations, trade and investment; or
(b) for the avoidance of double taxation of income under Income Tax Act, 1961 and under the corresponding
law in force in that specified territory outside India; or
(c) for exchange of information for the prevention of evasion or avoidance of income-tax chargeable under
Income Tax Act, 1961 or under the corresponding law in force in that specified territory, or investigation
of cases of such evasion or avoidance, or
(d) for recovery of income-tax under Income Tax Act, 1961 and under the corresponding law in force in that
specified territory outside India.
Where the Central Government has entered into an agreement with the specified association of any specified
territory outside India for granting relief of tax, avoidance of double taxation, then, the provisions of Income Tax Act,
1961 shall apply to the assessee to whom such agreement applies, to the extent they are more beneficial to him.
Note : The assessee shall also provide such other document & information as may be prescribed.

“Specified Association” for this section means any institution, association or body whether incorporated or
not, functioning under any law for the time being in force India or the laws of specified territory outside India
and which may be notified as such by the Central Government.
“Specified Territory” means any area outside India which may be notified as such by the Central Government
for the purpose section 90A. The provision under this section will apply to the assessees to the extent these
are beneficial to them. This section provides relief in respect of double taxation in respect to countries with
which India has no DTAA.
Circular No. 2 of 2016 dated 25th February, 2016 (Benefits of India – United Kingdom (UK) Double Taxation
Avoidance Agreement to UK partnerships firms)
The terms “person” in the DTAA does not specifically include ‘partnership firms’ have been bought to the notice
to the CBDT and further, clarify has been sought on whether the provision of the treaty are applicable to the
partnership. The Board, in exercise of the power conferred u/s 119 of the Act, clarifies that the provisions of the
India –UK DTAA would be applicable to partnership that is a resident of either India or UK to the extent that the
income derived by such partnership, estate or trust is subject to tax in that state as the income of the resident,
either in its own hands or in the hands of its partners or beneficiaries.

(c) Section 91: Countries with which no agreement exists
In any previous year, a person resident in India, has paid tax in any country with which India has no bilateral
agreement under Section 90 for the relief or avoidance of double taxation in respect of his income which accrued
or arose during that previous year under the law in force in that country , by deduction or otherwise ,he shall be
entitled to the deduction from the Indian Income Tax payable by him calculated on such doubly taxed income at this
Indian Rate of Tax or the rate of the said country which ever is lower or at Indian rate of tax ,if both rates are equal.
In case of any person resident in India, earns income from agricultural operation in Pakistan and paid tax thereof
can seek relief at rate being lower of the following alternatives namely :
(i) Tax actually paid in Pakistan
(ii) Amount computed under Indian Tax Rates.
If any non-resident person is assessed on his share in the income of a registered firm assessed as resident
person in India in any previous year and such share includes any income accruing or arising outside India
during that previous year (and which is not deemed to accrue or arise in India) in a country with which there is no
agreement under Section 90 for the relief or avoidance of double taxation and he proves that he has paid
income tax by deduction or otherwise under the law in force in that country in respect of the income so included
he shall be entitled:
– to a deduction from the Indian income tax payable by him of a sum calculated on such doubly taxed
income so included
– at the Average Indian Income Tax Rate or
– the Average Foreign Tax Rate ,
Whichever is lower or at the Indian rate of tax if both the rates are equal.

ENABLING THE BOARD TO NOTIFY RULES FOR GIVING FOREIGN TAX CREDIT
Sub-section (1) of section 91 of the Income-tax Act provides for relief in respect of income-tax on the income
which is taxed in India as well as in the country with which there is no Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement
(DTAA). It provides that an Indian resident is entitled to a deduction from the Indian income-tax of a sum calculated

Lesson 14

Basic Concepts of International Taxation

629

on such doubly taxed income, at the Indian rate of tax or the rate of tax of said country, whichever is lower. In
cases of countries with which India has entered into an agreement for the purposes of avoidance of double
taxation under section 90 or section 90A, a relief in respect of income-tax on doubly taxed income is available as
per the respective DTAAs.
The Income-tax Act does not provide the manner for granting credit of taxes paid in any country outside India.
Accordingly, an amendment is made in sub-section (2) of section 295 of the Income-tax Act so as to provide that
CBDT may make rules to provide the procedure for granting relief or deduction, as the case may be, of any
income-tax paid in any country or specified territory outside India, under section 90, or under section 90A, or
under section 91, against the income-tax payable under the Act.
This amendment took effect from 1st day of June, 2015.

NECESSITY FOR DTAA
The need for Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) arises because of rules in two different countries
regarding chargeability of income based on receipt and accrual, residential status etc. Double taxation is frequently
avoided through DTAAs entered into by two countries for the avoidance of double taxation on the same income.
The DTAA eliminates or mitigates the incidence of double taxation by sharing revenues arising out of international
transactions by the two contracting states to the agreement. As there is no clear definition of income and taxability
thereof, which is accepted internationally, an income may become liable to tax in two countries. In such a case,
the possibilities are as under:
1. The income is taxed only in one country.
2. The income is exempt in both countries.
3. The income is taxed in both countries, but credit for tax paid in one country is given against tax payable
in the other country.
If the two countries do not have DTAA then in such a case, the domestic law of the country will apply. In the case
of India, the provisions of Section 91 of the Income-Tax Act will apply. The Central Board of Direct Taxes has
clarified vide Circular No.333 dated 2nd April, 1982 that in case of a conflict in the provisions of the agreement
for Tax Avoidance of double taxation and the Income Tax Act, the provisions contained in the Agreement for
Double Tax Avoidance will prevail.
“Economic Liberalization in India” as earlier started from 1991 has covered a wide area touching upon the
different fields of international trade, exchange control, monetary and industrial policies, trade and fiscal policies,
economic and cultural relations aimed at accelerating the growth in all spheres with a view to bringing about
globalization of the India economy. The liberal and broad based economic and commercial relationship between
India and various foreign countries in recent years had led to more collaboration and joint ventures at various
levels in the public and private sectors to keep pace with the ever changing international advancement in trade,
commerce, science and technology. The inflow of multinationals to setup business ventures in India coupled
with the funds from Non-residents coming for short-term and long-term investments in India have helped to
achieve a sound and stable economy and India today stands recognized internationally. The political situations
due to changes in the Governments at the central and state levels have not adversely affected the growth of
international trade and commerce between India and other countries.
The Government of India has entered into numerous tax treaties as well as trade agreements with various
foreign countries to provide stability and certainty to the tax laws and commercial relationship between the
parties in India and abroad. The large number of judicial pronouncements including advance rulings in the
recent years under the tax laws, both direct and indirect, have added to the confidence of Non-residents being
inspired with the Indian fiscal and judicial systems. The wealth of judicial decisions from the Supreme Court as
well as the High Courts and the tribunals in deciding numerous tax disputes help to remove the uncertainties
and ambiguities in the tax system and administration. The tax treaties have helped both the collaborators from
abroad and the Indian enterprises in the private and public sectors to know precisely the nature, extent and
scope of the tax liability as also the country in which tax is payable.

Taxation of Income from Air and Shipping Transport under DTAA
The DTAA is based on four basic models of DTAA and they are – OECD Model Tax Convention (emphasis is on
residence principle), UN Model (combination of residence and source principle but the emphasis is on source
principle), US Model (it’s the Model to be followed for entering into DTAAs with the U.S. and its peculiar to the
US) and the Andean Model (model adopted by member States namely Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Columbia, Peru
and Venezuela).
Income derived from the operation of Air transport in international traffic by an enterprise of one contracting state
will not be taxed in the other contracting state. In respect of an enterprise of one contracting state, income
earned in the other contracting state from the operation of ships in international traffic, will be taxed in that
contracting state wherein the place of effective management of enterprise is situated. However some DTA
agreements contain provisions to tax the income in the other contracting state also, although at reduced rate.
These agreements follow a near uniform pattern in as much as India has guided itself by the UN model of double
taxation avoidance agreements. The agreements allocate jurisdiction between the source and residence country.
Wherever such jurisdiction is given to both the countries, the agreements prescribe maximum rate of taxation in
the source country which is generally lower than the rate of tax under the domestic laws of that country. The
double taxation in such cases are avoided by the residence country agreeing to give credit for tax paid in the
source country thereby reducing tax payable in the residence country by the amount of tax paid in the source
country. These agreements give the right of taxation in respect of the income of the nature of interest, dividend,
royalty and fees for technical services to the country of residence. However the source country is also given the
right but such taxation in the source country has to be limited to the rates prescribed in the agreement. The rate
of taxation is on gross receipts without deduction of expenses.

The Concept of Permanent Establishment (PE)
One of the important terms that occur in all the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements is the term 'Permanent
Establishment' (PE) which has not been defined in the Income Tax Act. However as per the Double Taxation
Avoidance Agreements, PE includes, a wide variety of arrangements i.e. a place of management, a branch, an
office, a factory, a workshop or a warehouse, a mine, a quarry, an oilfield etc. Imposition of tax on a foreign
enterprise is done only if it has a PE in the contracting state. Tax is computed by treating the PE as a distinct and
independent enterprise.
Some Salient aspects concerning a PE could be discussed as under :
– PE is defined with reference to place and persons;
– PE could be a fixed place, a construction site, service PE, agency PE branch etc.
– PE denotes non-resident’s business preserves. The degree of preserve which could constitute PE has
been illustrated by ‘inclusions and exclusions’.
– An enterprise is liable to tax on its profits in a foreign country, if it conducts its subsidiary in that country
through PE.
Isolated or occasional transactions through some persons or agency do not create liability for tax is the basis of
PE. There has to be continuity of activities contributing to the earning of income–something more than mere
transaction of purchase and sale or transactions of preparatory or auxiliary nature. Such activities must be value
creating activities requiring capital and lesson. ‘Permanent’ in PE does not mean everlasting.
In order to avoid double taxation it is provided that if a resident of India becomes liable to pay tax either directly
or by deduction in the other country in respect of income from any source, he shall be allowed credit against the
Indian tax payable in respect of such income in an amount not exceeding the tax borne by him in the other
country on that portion of the income which is taxed in the said other country. The same benefit is available to the
resident of the other Country, on income taxed in India.

EQUALISATION LEVY
A New business models have created new tax challenges. The typical direct tax issues relating to e-commerce
are the difficulties of characterizing the nature of payment and establishing a nexus or link between a taxable
transaction, activity and a taxing jurisdiction, the difficulty of locating the transaction, activity and identifying the
taxpayer for income tax purposes. The digital business fundamentally challenges physical presence-based
permanent establishment rules. If permanent establishment (PE) principles are to remain effective in the new
economy, the fundamental PE components developed for the old economy i.e. place of business, location, and
permanency must be reconciled with the new digital reality.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has recommended, in Base Erosion
and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project under Action Plan 1, several options to tackle the direct tax challenges which
include modifying the existing Permanent Establishment (PE) rule to include that where an enterprise engaged
in fully de-materialized digital activities would constitute a Permanent Establishment ‘PE’ if it maintained a significant
digital presence in another country’s economy. It further recommended a virtual fixed place of business PE in
the concept of PE i.e. creation of a PE when the enterprise maintains a website on a server of another enterprise
located in a jurisdiction and carries on business through that website. It also recommended to impose of a final
withholding tax on certain payments for digital goods or services provided by a foreign e-commerce provider or
imposition of a equalisation levy on consideration for certain digital transactions received by a non-resident from
a resident or from a non-resident having permanent establishment in other contracting state.
Considering the potential of new digital economy and the rapidly evolving nature of business operations it is
found essential to address the challenges in terms of taxation of such digital transactions as mentioned
above. In order to address these challenges, a new Chapter has been inserted vide Finance Act, 2016, titled
“Equalisation Levy”, to provide for an equalisation levy of 6 % of the amount of consideration for specified
services received or receivable by a non-resident not having permanent establishment (‘PE’) in India, from a
resident in India who carries out business or profession, or from a non-resident having permanent establishment
in India.
Further, in order to reduce burden of small players in the digital domain, it is also provided that no such levy shall
be made if the aggregate amount of consideration for specified services received or receivable by a non-resident
from a person resident in India or from a non-resident having a permanent establishment in India does not
exceed one lakh rupees in any previous year.
Further, In order to avoid double taxation, exemption under section 10 of the Act has also been provided for any
income arising from providing specified services on which equalisation levy is chargeable.

APPLICABILITY OF MINIMUM ALTERNATE TAX (MAT) ON FOREIGN COMPANIES FOR THE
PERIOD PRIOR TO 01.04.2015
Under the existing provisions contained in sub-section (1) of the 115JB in case of a company, if the tax payable
on the total income as computed under the Income-tax Act, is less than eighteen and one-half per cent of its
book profit, such book profit shall be deemed to be the total income of the assessee and the tax payable by the
assessee for the relevant previous year shall be eighteen and one-half per cent of its book profit. Issues were
raised regarding the applicability of this provision to Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) who do not have a
permanent establishment (PE) in India. Vide Finance Act, 2015 of the provisions of section 115JB were amended
to provide that in case of a foreign company any income chargeable at a rate lower than the rate specified in
section 115JB shall be reduced from the book profits and the corresponding expenditure will be added back.
However, since this amendment was prospective w.e.f. assessment year 2016-17, the issue for assessment
year prior to 2016-17 remained to be addressed.
With a view to provide certainty in taxation of foreign companies, the provision has been amended vide Finance

632 EP-TL&P
Act, 2016 so as to provide that with effect from 01.04.2001, the provisions of section 115JB shall not be applicable
to a foreign company if –
• the assessee is a resident of a country or a specified territory with which India has an agreement
referred to in sub-section (1) of section 90 or the Central Government has adopted any agreement
under sub-section (1) of section 90A and the assesse does not have a permanent establishment in
India in accordance with the provisions of such Agreement; or
• the assessee is a resident of a country with which India does not have an agreement of the nature
referred to in clause (i) above and the assessee is not required to seek registration under any law for the
time being in force relating to companies.
This amendment effective retrospectively from the 1st day of April, 2001 and accordingly apply in relation
to assessment year 2001-02 and subsequent years.

TAXATION ASPECT OF INTERNATIONAL MERGER AND ACQUISITIONS
The law relating to transfer pricing in India is still in its infancy. Some decisions recently from the Tribunal and
High Court have clarified some issues. However, by its very nature the law to procedures on the subject are
sound to be long drawn and complicated. It will take time before the concepts get cleared and stabilized.
With the Globalised economy, trans-border merger and acquisitions are now common phenomena specially in
advanced and developing companies. India is catching up with the world trend with respect to transactions
involving Mergers and Acquisitions and cross border acquisitions and mergers are getting popular.
In India Mergers and Acquisitions take place in the following ways:
Mergers and Acquisitions
Amalgamation/Merger
De-merger

Acquisition
Asset Purchase
Slump Sale

Stock Purchase

Itemized Sale

Definition of ‘Amalgamation’ under the Income Tax Act, 1961
Section 2(1B). It is defined thus : “Amalgamation” in relation to companies means, the merger of one or more
companies with another company or the merger of two or more companies to form one company”

– All liabilities including contingent liabilities to be transferred from amalgamating company to amalgamated
company.
– Shareholders holding at least 3/4th in value of shares of the amalgamating company should become
shareholders of the amalgamated company.

ACQUISITION
No definition of ‘Acquisition has been given of the term in the Income Tax Act. However, as per Section 2(1B) of
the Income Tax Act amalgamation is not include acquisition. The relevant portion in section 2(1B) reads thus :
“Amalgamation”, in relation to companies, means the merger of one or more companies with another company

Lesson 14

company by virtue of the amalgamation.
Otherwise than as a result of the acquisition of the property of one company by another company pursuant to the
purchase of such property by the other company or as a result of the distribution of such property to the other

TRANSFER PRICING
In the present age of globalization, diversification and expansion, most of the companies are working under the
umbrella of group engaged in diversified fields/sectors leading to large number of transactions between related
parties.
Related Party transaction means the transaction between/among the parties which are associated by reason of
common control, common ownership or other common interest.
The mechanism for accounting, the pricing for these related transactions is called Transfer Pricing.
Transfer Price refers to the price of goods/services which is used in accounting for transfer of goods or services
from one responsibility centre to another or from one company to another associated company. Transfer price
affect the revenue of transferring division and the cost of receiving division. As a result, the profitability, return on
investment and managerial performance evaluation of both divisions are also affected.
This may be understood well by the following example
1. Arihant & Companies is a group of Companies engaged in diversified business. One of its units i.e. Unit
X is engaged in manufacturing of automotive batteries. Another Unit Y is engaged in manufacturing of
Industrial Trucks. Unit X is supplying automotive batteries to Unit Y. In such cases transfer price mechanism
is used to account for the transfer of automotive batteries.
2. XYZ Co. is expert in providing electrical and electronic services. It is engaged in providing support to its
associated company as well as it is engaged in outsourcing contract. If XYZ Co. provides some services
to its associated company, the transaction should be accounted at price calculated using transfer price
mechanism.

IMPORTANCE OF TRANSFER PRICING
Transfer pricing mechanism is very important for following reasons:
1. Helpful in correct pricing of Product/Services - An effective transfer pricing mechanism helps an
organization in correctly pricing its product and services. Since in any organization, transaction between
associated parties occurs frequently, it is necessary to value all transaction correctly so that the final
product/ services may be priced correctly.
2. Helpful in Performance Evaluation : For the performance evaluation of any entity, it is necessary that all
economic transactions are accounted. Calculation of correct transfer price is necessary for accounting
of inter related transaction between two Associated enterprises.
3. Helpful in complying Statutory Legislations : Since related party transaction have a direct bearing on the
profitability or cost of a company, the effective transfer pricing mechanism is very necessary. For example,
if the related party transactions are measured at less value, one unit may incur loss and other unit may
earn undue profit. This will result in income tax imbalances at both parties end. Similarly, wrong transfer
pricing may lead to wrong payment of excise duty, custom duty /sales tax (if applicable) as well.

TRANSFER PRICING PROVISIONS IN INDIA
Increasing participation of multi-national groups in economic activities in India has given rise to new and complex
issues emerging from transactions entered into between two or more enterprises belonging to the same group.
Hence, there was a need to introduce a uniform and internationally accepted mechanism of determining
reasonable, fair and equitable profits and taxes in India. Accordingly, the Finance Act, 2001 introduced law of
transfer pricing in India through Sections 92 to 92F of the Income Tax Act, 1961 which guides computation of the
transfer price and suggests detailed documentation procedures. Year 2012 brought a big change in transfer
pricing regulations in India whereby government extended the applicability of transfer pricing regulations to

636 EP-TL&P
specified domestic transactions which are enumerated in Section 92BA. This would help in curbing the practice
of transferring profit from a taxable domestic zone to tax free domestic zone.
As stated earlier, the fundamental of transfer pricing provision is that transfer price should represent the arm’s
length price of goods transferred and services rendered from one unit to another unit.

WHAT IS ARM’S LENGTH PRICE?
In general arm’s length price means fair price of goods transferred or services rendered. In other words, the
transfer price should represent the price which could be charged from an independent party in uncontrolled
conditions. Arm’s length price calculation is very important for a company. In case the transfer price is not at
arm’s length, it may have following consequences
A. Wrong performance evaluation
B. Wrong pricing of final product (In case where the goods/services are used in the manufacturing of final
product)
C. Non compliances of applicable laws and thus attraction of penalty provisions.
The same may be explained with the following examples
Company X and Company Y is working under the common umbrella of Mohan & Company. Company X
manufactures a product which is raw material for Company Y.
Case

Criteria

Effect on Company X

Effect on Company Y

1

Company X charges price
more than the Arm’s length
price from Company Y

The revenue of company X
will increase.

The total cost of company Y will
increase. This will result into wrong
pricing of its product which may further
lead to uncomptetiveness of its
product

2

Company X charges price
less than the Arm’s length
price from Company Y

The revenue of company X
will decrease. The parent
company may close the
company X treating it as loss
making entity.

The total cost of company Y will
decrease. Therefore, the company Y
may charge lower price which may
lead to loss at an entity level.

3

Company X charges Arm’s
Length price from
Company Y

The revenue of company X
will be representing true and
fair view of its operation.

Company Y will be paying the price
as equivalent to market price of
Company X product and its cost will
be correct. On the basis of the cost
arrived after considering the arm’s
length price of company X product,
company Y will be able to take correct
price decision.

“The concept of associated enterprises and International transaction are very important for applying the transfer
pricing provisions. Section 92A and Section 92B deals with these two important concepts of chapter X of Income
Tax Act, 1961.”

ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES (AE)
Associated Enterprises has been defined in Section 92A of the Act. It prescribes that “associated enterprise”, in
relation to another enterprise, means an enterprise–

Lesson 14

Basic Concepts of International Taxation

637

(a) Which participates, directly or indirectly, or through one or more intermediaries, in the management or
control or capital of the other enterprise; or
(b) In respect of which one or more persons who participate, directly or indirectly, or through one or more
intermediaries, in its management or control or capital, are the same persons who participate, directly or
indirectly, or through one or more intermediaries, in the management or control or capital of the other
enterprise.
Thus, from above definition we may understand that
The basic criterion to determine an AE is the participation in management, control or capital (ownership) of one
enterprise by another enterprise whereby the participation may be direct or indirect or through one or more
intermediaries, control may be direct or indirect.

Deemed Associated Enterprises
As per Section 92A(2), two enterprises shall be deemed to be associated enterprises if, at any time during the
previous year,–
(a) one enterprise holds, directly or indirectly, shares carrying not less than twenty-six per cent of the voting
power in the other enterprise; or
(b) any person or enterprise holds, directly or indirectly, shares carrying not less than twenty-six per cent of
the voting power in each of such enterprises; or
(c) a loan advanced by one enterprise to the other enterprise constitutes not less than fifty-one per cent of
the book value of the total assets of the other enterprise; or
(d) one enterprise guarantees not less than ten per cent of the total borrowings of the other enterprise; or
(e) more than half of the board of directors or members of the governing board, or one or more executive
directors or executive members of the governing board of one enterprise, are appointed by the other
enterprise; or
(f) more than half of the directors or members of the governing board, or one or more of the executive
directors or members of the governing board, of each of the two enterprises are appointed by the same
person or persons; or
(g) the manufacture or processing of goods or articles or business carried out by one enterprise is wholly
dependent on the use of know-how, patents, copyrights, trade-marks, licences, franchises or any other
business or commercial rights of similar nature, or any data, documentation, drawing or specification
relating to any patent, invention, model, design, secret formula or process, of which the other enterprise
is the owner or in respect of which the other enterprise has exclusive rights; or
(h) ninety per cent or more of the raw materials and consumables required for the manufacture or processing
of goods or articles carried out by one enterprise, are supplied by the other enterprise, or by persons
specified by the other enterprise, and the prices and other conditions relating to the supply are influenced
by such other enterprise; or
(i) the goods or articles manufactured or processed by one enterprise, are sold to the other enterprise or to
persons specified by the other enterprise, and the prices and other conditions relating thereto are
influenced by such other enterprise; or
(j) where one enterprise is controlled by an individual, the other enterprise is also controlled by such
individual or his relative or jointly by such individual and relative of such individual; or
(k) where one enterprise is controlled by a Hindu undivided family, the other enterprise is controlled by a

638 EP-TL&P
member of such Hindu undivided family or by a relative of a member of such Hindu undivided family or
jointly by such member and his relative; or
(l) where one enterprise is a firm, association of persons or body of individuals, the other enterprise holds
not less than ten per cent interest in such firm, association of persons or body of individuals; or
(m) there exists between the two enterprises, any relationship of mutual interest, as may be prescribed.
In Summary, two enterprises will be deemed as Associated Enterprises if

MEANING OF INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION
International Transaction have been defined vide Section 92B of Income Tax Act. It provides that “International
Transaction” means a transaction between two or more associated enterprises, either or both of whom are nonresidents, in the nature of purchase, sale or lease of tangible or intangible property, or provision of services, or
lending or borrowing money, or any other transaction having a bearing on the profits, income, losses or assets
of such enterprises, and shall include a mutual agreement or arrangement between two or more associated
enterprises for the allocation or apportionment of, or any contribution to, any cost or expense incurred or to be
incurred in connection with a benefit, service or facility provided or to be provided to any one or more of such
enterprises.

Deemed International Transaction
As per Section 92B(2) of Income Tax Act, A transaction entered into by an enterprise with a person other than an
associated enterprise shall, for the purposes of sub-section (1), be deemed to be an international transaction
entered into between two associated enterprises, if there exists a prior agreement in relation to the relevant
transaction between such other person and the associated enterprise, or the terms of the relevant transaction
are determined in substance between such other person and the associated enterprise where the enterprise or
the associated enterprice or both of them are non-resident irrespective of whether such other person is nonresident or not.
Finance Act, 2012 has added an explanation for the purpose of Definition 92B and it provides that the expression
“international transaction” shall include –
(a) the purchase, sale, transfer, lease or use of tangible property including building, transportation vehicle,
machinery, equipment, tools, plant, furniture, commodity or any other article, product or thing;
(b) the purchase, sale, transfer, lease or use of intangible property, including the transfer of ownership
or the provision of use of rights regarding land use, copyrights, patents, trademarks, licences,

(e) A transaction of business restructuring or reorganization, entered into by an enterprise with an associated
enterprise, irrespective of the fact that it has bearing on the profit, income, losses or assets of such
enterprises at the time of the transaction or at any future date.
The term “intangible property” have also been elaborated and explanation to Section 92B provides that the
expression Intangible shall include :
(a) Marketing related intangible assets, such as, trademarks, trade names, brand names, logos;
(b) Technology related intangible assets, such as, process patents, patent applications, technical
documentation such as laboratory notebooks, technical know-how;

The above explanation has added a vide range of Intangibles and the purpose of the explanation is to extend
the applicability of Transfer pricing code to all International transaction involving the exchange of Intangibles
which are not expressly available for trade .

TRANSFER PRICING – APPLICABILITY TO DOMESTIC TRANSACTIONS
Honourable Supreme court in the case of CIT v. Glaxo SmithKline Asia (P) Ltd., (2010) 195 Taxman 35 (SC) has
advised that it needs to be considered whether the regulations should be applied to domestic transactions in

640 EP-TL&P
cases where such transactions are not revenue-neutral. The facts and ruling of Honourable Supreme Court is
following:
CIT v. Glaxo SmithKline Asia (P) Ltd., (2010) 195 Taxman 35 (SC)
Facts
1. Glaxo SmithKline Asia (P) Ltd (GSK) entered into an agremeent with Glaxo Smith Kline Consumer
Healthcare Ltd (“GSKCH”) whereby GSKCH would provide all administrative services relating to
marketing, finance, Human Resource (HR) to GSK for cost +5% markup.
2. The AO disallowed a part of the charges reimbursed on the ground that they were excessive and not for
business purposes. On appeal by GSK, CIT (Appeals) upheld the decision of AO.
3. GSK appeal to Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) and ITAT ruled that AO has no power to disallow
any expenditure as excessive or unreasonable unless the case falls within the scope of Section 40A(2).
The revenue appeal to high court and revenue appeal was dismissed by High court.
4. For subsequent years AO continued to follow the same approach and GSK continued to get relief from
ITAT. Having regard to the delay on the part of revenue to give effect to ITAT order GSK filled a writ
petition before the High Court and High court issued direction to the Revenue to issue refund of taxes
along with applicable interest.
Supreme Court Ruling
1. The revenue filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) before the Honorable Supreme Court and Supreme
Court held that since the exercise is revenue neutral and both the parties are not related parties in terms
of Section 40A(2) of Income tax act, no interference is called for and the SLP filled by the Revenue is
dismissed.
2. The honourable Supreme Court then stated that the larger issue is whether Transfer Pricing provisions
should be limited to cross-border transactions or whether the Transfer Pricing Regulations be extended
to domestic transactions. In domestic transactions, the under-invoicing of sales and over-invoicing of
expenses ordinarily will be revenue neutral in nature, except in two circumstances having tax arbitrage
such as where one of the related entities is (i) loss making or (ii) liable to pay tax at a lower rate and the
profits are shifted to such entity;
3. The Supreme Court further held that the complications arise in cases where the fair market value is
required to be assigned to transactions between related parties u/s 40A(2). The Central Board of Direct
taxes (CBDT) should examine whether Transfer Pricing provisions can be applied to domestic transactions
between related parties u/s 40A(2) by making amendments to the Act. The AO can be empowered to
make adjustments to the income declared by the assessee having regard to the fair market value of the
transactions between the related parties and can apply any of the generally accepted methods of
determination of arm’s length price, including the methods provided under Transfer Pricing provisions.
The law can also be amended to make it compulsory for the taxpayer to maintain Books of Accounts
and other documents on the lines prescribed in Rule 10D and obtain an audit report from his Chartered
Accountant (CA) that proper documents are maintained;
4. Finally it was held that though the Court normally does not make recommendations or suggestions, in
order to reduce litigation occurring in complicated matters, the question of extending Transfer Pricing
regulations to domestic transactions require expeditious consideration by the Ministry of Finance and
the CBDT may also consider issuing appropriate instructions in that regard.

SPECIFIED DOMESTIC TRANSACTIONS
Finance Act, 2012 has made a very important change and it has extended the applicability of Transfer Pricing
Provisions to specified domestic transaction w.e.f. 1st April, 2012.
The specified domestic party transactions would essentially include payment made by a company to a related
person referred to in Section 40A(2)(b) of the Act including payment to a director of the company or any person
who has a substantial interest in the company (that is, has a beneficial ownership of shares carrying not less
than 20 per cent of voting power); transactions referred to in Section 80A(6) of the Act (for example, transfer of
goods or services from a tax-incentivised unit/entity to a non-tax-incentivised unit/entity and vice-versa); and
transactions referred to in Section 80IA(8), 80IA(10) and 10AA(9) of the Act (carried out by industrial undertakings,
infrastructure companies and units operating in special economic zones).
Section 92BA has been added in Transfer Price Code by Finance Act, 2012 which provides that –
“Specified domestic transaction” in case of an assessee means any of the following transactions, not being
an international transaction, namely:–
(i) Any expenditure in respect of which payment has been made or is to be made to a person referred to
in clause (b) of sub-section (2) of section 40A;
(ii) Any transaction referred to in section 80A;
(iii) Any transfer of goods or services referred to in sub-section (8) of section 80-IA;
(iv) Any business transacted between the assessee and other person as referred to in sub-section (10) of
section 80-IA;
(v) Any transaction, referred to in any other section under Chapter VI-A or section 10AA, to which provisions
of sub-section (8) or sub-section (10) of section 80-IA are applicable; or
(vi) Any other transaction as may be prescribed,
and where the aggregate of such transactions entered into by the assessee in the previous year exceeds a
sum of five crore rupees.
Thus a specified domestic transaction means a transaction which is covered by criteria as given in section 92BA
and the aggregate value of such transactions exceeds `5 crore in a year.

Raising the Threshold for Specified Domestic Transaction
The existing provisions of section 92BA of the Act define “specified domestic transaction” in case of an assessee
to mean any of the specified transactions, not being an international transaction, where the aggregate of such
transactions entered into by the assessee in the previous year exceeds a sum of five crore rupees.
In order to address the issue of compliance cost in case of small businesses on account of low threshold of five
crores rupees, an amendment is made in section 92BA to provide that the aggregate of specified transactions
entered into by the assessee in the previous year should exceed a sum of twenty crore rupees for such
transaction to be treated as ‘specified domestic transaction’.
This amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2016 and will, accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment
year 2016-17 and subsequent assessment years.

TRANSFER PRICING – METHODS
Section 92C of Income Tax Act defines the methods which are to be used in determination of Arm's Length
prices for International Transaction and specified domestic transaction. The arm's length price in relation to an
international transaction/specified domestic transaction shall be determined by any of the following methods,

642 EP-TL&P
being the most appropriate method, having regard to the nature of transaction or class of transaction or class of
associated persons or functions performed by such persons or such other relevant factors as the Board may
prescribe, namely :(A) Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method (CUP)
(B) Resale Price Method (RPM)
(C) Cost Plus Method (CPM)
(D) Profit Split Method (PSM)
(E) Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM)
(F) Such other method as may be prescribed by the Board.
Various transfer pricing methods which are prescribed by Income Tax Act, 1961 are as under:

(A) COMPARABLE UNCONTROLLED PRICE METHOD
Comparable Uncontrolled Price (“CUP”) method compares the price charged for property or services transferred
in a controlled transaction to the price charged for property or services transferred in a comparable uncontrolled
transaction in comparable circumstances.
An Uncontrolled price is the price agreed between the unrelated parties for the transfer of goods or services. If
this uncontrolled price is comparable with the price charged for transfer of goods or services between the
Associated Enterprises, then that price is Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP). This is the most direct method
for the determination of the Arms’ length price.

Methods of CUP
CUP can be either
(a) Internal CUP or
(b) External CUP
Internal CUP is available, when the tax payer enters into a similar transaction with unrelated parties, as is done
with a related party as well. This is considered a very good comparable, as the functions performed, processes
involved, risks undertaken and assets employed are all easily comparable – more so, on “an apple to apple
basis”.
The external CUP is available if a transaction between two independent enterprises takes place under comparable
conditions involving comparable goods or services. For example an independent enterprise buys or sells a
similar product, in similar quantities under similar term from / to another independent enterprise in a similar
market will be termed as external CUP.

Applicability of the CUP Method
Comparable Uncontrolled Price method is treated as most reliable method of transfer pricing calculation but it is
not easy to find the controllable price method easily. The CUP is believed to be the most reliable / best method,
if one could identify and map it. CUP method can be applied without any difficulty in following circumstances.
(1) Interest payment on a loan
(2) Royalty payment
(3) Software development where products are often licensed to a third party
(4) Price charged for homogeneous items like traded goods

Lesson 14

643

(B) RESALE PRICE METHOD
Rule 10B (1) (b) of Income Tax Rules, 1962 prescribes Resale Price method by which,
A. The price at which property purchased or services obtained by the enterprise from an associated
enterprise is resold or are provided to an unrelated enterprise is identified;
B. Such resale price is reduced by the amount of a normal gross profit margin accruing to the enterprise or
to an unrelated enterprise from the purchase and resale of the same or similar property or from obtaining
and providing the same or similar services, in a comparable uncontrolled transaction, or a number of
such transactions;
C. The price so arrived at is further reduced by the expenses incurred by the enterprise in connection with
the purchase of property or obtaining of services;
D. The price so arrived at is adjusted to take into account the functional and other differences, including
differences in accounting practices, if any, between the international transaction or specified domestic
transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transactions, or between the enterprises entering into
such transactions, which could materially affect the amount of gross profit margin in the open market;
E. The adjusted price arrived at under sub-clause (iv) is taken to be an arms length price in respect of the
purchase of the property or obtaining of the services by the enterprise from the associated enterprise.
Example
1. A sold a machine to B (Associated enterprise) and in turn B sold the same machinery to C (an
independent party) at sale margin of 30% for `2,10,000 but without making any additional expenses
and change. Here Arm’s length price would be calculated as
Sales price to B

=

2, 10,000

Gross Margin

=

10,000 × 30% = 63,000

Transfer price

=

1, 47,000

2. A sold a machine to B (Associated enterprise) and in turn B sold the same machinery to C (an
independent party) at sale margin of 30% for `4,00,000 but B has incurred 4000 in sending the machine
to C. Here Arm’s length price would be calculated as
Sales price to B

=

4, 00,000

Gross Margin

=

4,00,000 × 30%=1, 20,000

Balance

=

2, 80,000

Less: Expenses incurred by B =

4,000

Arm’s length price= 2,76,000

(C) COST PLUS METHOD
Rule 10B (1) (c) of Income tax Rules, 1962 prescribes Cost Plus Method, by which,
(i) The direct and indirect costs of production incurred by the enterprise in respect of property transferred
or services provided to an associated enterprise, are determined;
(ii) The amount of a normal gross profit mark-up to such costs (computed according to the same accounting
norms) arising from the transfer or provision of the same or similar property or services by the enterprise,
or by an unrelated enterprise, in a comparable uncontrolled transaction, or a number of such transactions,
is determined;

644 EP-TL&P
(iii) The normal gross profit mark-up so determined is adjusted to take into account the functional and other
differences, if any, between the international transaction or specified domestic transaction and the
comparable uncontrolled transactions, or between the enterprises entering into such transactions, which
could materially affect such profit mark-up in the open market;
(iv) The costs referred to in sub-clause (i) are increased by the adjusted profit mark-up arrived at under subclause (iii);
(v) The sum so arrived at is taken to be an arm’s length price in relation to the supply of the property or
provision of services by the enterprise.
Under the Cost Plus Method, an arm’s-length price equals the controlled party’s cost of producing the tangible
property plus an appropriate gross profit mark-up, defined as the ratio of gross profit to cost of goods sold
(excluding operating expenses) for a comparable uncontrolled transaction.
The formulas for the transfer price in inter company transactions of products are as follows:
TP = COGS × (1 + mark-up), where:
• TP = Transfer Price of a product sold between a manufacturing company and a related company;
• COGS = Cost of goods sold of the manufacturing company
• Cost plus mark-up = gross profit mark-up defined as the ratio of gross profit to cost of goods sold
Gross profit is defined as sales minus cost of goods sold.
As an example, let us assume that the COGS in a transaction between two associated enterprises is ` 5,000.
Assume that an arm’s length gross profit mark-up that Associated Enterprise 1 should earn is 50%. The resulting
transfer price between Associated Enterprise 1 and Associated Enterprise 2 is `7,500 [i.e. ` 5,000 × (1 + 0.50)].
In this method, calculation of cost of goods sold and gross margin are the most important factor.

(D) PROFIT SPLIT METHOD
Rule 10B (1) (d) of Income tax Rules, 1962 prescribes Profit Split Method, which may be applicable mainly in
international transactions or specified domestic transaction involving transfer of unique intangibles or in multiple
international transactions or specified domestic transaction which are so interrelated that they cannot be evaluated
separately for the purpose of determining the arm's length price of any one transaction, by which:
(i) The combined net profit of the associated enterprises arising from the international transaction or specified
domestic transaction in which they are engaged, is determined;
(ii) The relative contribution made by each of the associated enterprises to the earning of such combined
net profit, is then evaluated on the basis of the functions performed, assets employed or to be employed
and risks assumed by each enterprise and on the basis of reliable external market data which indicates
how such contribution would be evaluated by unrelated enterprises performing comparable functions in
similar circumstances;
(iii) The combined net profit is then split amongst the enterprises in proportion to their relative contributions,
as computed above;
(iv) The profit thus apportioned to the assessee is taken into account to arrive at an arm’s length price in
relation to the international transaction or specified domestic transaction.
However, the combined net profit as determined in sub-clause (i) may, in the first instance, be partially allocated
to each enterprise so as to provide it with a basic return appropriate for the type of international transaction or
specified domestic transaction in which it is engaged, with reference to market returns achieved for similar types
of transactions by independent enterprises, and thereafter, the residual net profit remaining after such allocation

Lesson 14

645

Basic Concepts of International Taxation

may be split amongst the enterprises in proportion to their relative contribution in the manner specified under
sub-clauses (ii) and (iii), and in such a case the aggregate of the net profit allocated to the enterprise in the first
instance together with the residual net profit apportioned to that enterprise on the basis of its relative contribution
shall be taken to be the net profit arising to that enterprise from the international transaction or specified domestic
transaction.
Two step Approach of Profit Spilt Method
Step 1: Allocation of sufficient profit to each enterprise to provide a basic compensation for routine contributions.
This basic compensation does not include a return for possible valuable intangible assets owned by the
associated enterprises. The basic compensation is determined based on the returns earned by comparable
independent enterprises for comparable transactions or, more frequently, functions.
Step 2: Allocation of residual profit (i.e. profit remaining after step 1) between the associated enterprises
based on the facts and circumstances. If the residual profit is attributable to intangible property, then the
allocation of this profit should be based on the relative value of each enterprise’s contributions of intangible
property.
Example on the Profit Split Method (Residual Analysis Approach)
Company A is an Indian Company and deals in telecommunication products. It has developed a Microprocessor
and it holds the patent for manufacturing of the microprocessor. Company B which is an overseas subsidiary of
Company A is engaged in manufacturing of Mobile equipment at Australia. Company A supply the microprocessor
to company B for using it in Mobile equipment and company B in turn after manufacturing the mobile sends the
mobile to company “A” in India. Company A sells all the mobile in India.
Both companies contribute to the success of the mobile equipment through their design of the microprocessor
and the equipment. As the nature of the products is very advanced and unique, the group is unable to locate any
comparable with similar intangible assets. Therefore, neither the traditional methods i.e. CUP Method, RSP
Method nor the TNMM is appropriate in this case.
Nevertheless, the group is able to obtain reliable data on hand phone contract manufacturers and equipment
wholesalers without unique intangible property in the telecommunication industry. The manufacturers earn a
mark-up of 10% while the wholesalers derive a 25% margin on sales.
Company A’s and Company B’s respective share of profit is determined in 2 steps using the profit split method
(residual analysis approach).
Step 1 – Determining the basic return
The simplified accounts of Company A and Company B are shown below:

The total operating margin of the group is ` 17.25 Lakhs.
Step 2 : Dividing the residual profit
The residual profit of the group is = ` 45 Lakhs – ` 17.25 Lakhs = ` 27.75 Lakhs
On further study of the two companies, two particular expense items, R&D expenses and marketing expenses,
are identified as the key intangibles critical to the success of the mobile equipment. The R&D expenses and
marketing expenses incurred by each company are:
Company A

12 Lakhs (80%)

Company B

3 Lakhs (20%)

Assuming that the R&D and marketing expenses are equally significant in contributing to the residual profits,
based on the proportionate expenses incurred:
Company A’s share of residual profit (80% × 27.75)
= ` 22.20 Lakhs
Company B’s share of residual profit (20% × 27.75)
= ` 5.55 Lakhs
Therefore, the adjusted operating profit of
Company A is = ` 22.20 L + ` 16.25 L = ` 38.45 Lakhs
Company B is = ` 5.55 + ` 1 = ` 6.55 Lakhs.

(E) TRANSACTIONAL NET MARGIN METHOD (TNMM)
Rule 10B (1) (e) of Income Tax Rules, 1962 prescribes, Transactional net margin method, by which,
(i) The net profit margin realized by the enterprise from an international transaction or specified domestic
transaction entered into with an associated enterprise is computed in relation to costs incurred or sales
effected or assets employed or to be employed by the enterprise or having regard to any other relevant
base;
(ii) The net profit margin realized by the enterprise or by an unrelated enterprise from a comparable
uncontrolled transaction or a number of such transactions is computed having regard to the same base;
(iii) The net profit margin referred to in (ii) arising in comparable uncontrolled transactions is adjusted to
take into account the differences, if any, between the international transaction or specified domestic
transaction and the comparable uncontrolled transactions, or between the enterprises entering into
such transactions, which could materially affect the amount of net profit margin in the open market;
(iv) the net profit margin realized by the enterprise and referred to in (i) is established to be the same as the
net profit margin referred to in (iii);
(v) The net profit margin thus established is then taken into account to arrive at an arms length price in
relation to the international transaction or specified domestic transaction.
Example
Nikhil & Co is an India manufacturer of dishwashers. All Nikhil & Co’s dishwashers are sold to an overseas
associated enterprise, Company G, and bears Company G’s brand. Company G, a household electrical
appliances brand name, sells only dishwashers manufactured by Nikhil & Co.
The CUP method is not applied in this case because no reliable adjustments can be made to account for
differences with similar products in the market. After the appropriate functional analysis, Nikhil & Co was able
to identify an Indian manufacturer of home electrical appliances, Company H, as a suitable comparable
company. However, Company H performs warranty functions for its independent wholesalers, whereas Nikhil
& Co does not. Company H realizes a net mark up (i.e. operating margin) of 10%.
As the costs pertaining to the warranty functions cannot be separately identified in Company H’s accounts
and no reliable adjustments can be made to account for the difference in the functions, it may be more
reliable to examine the net margins in this case. The transfer price for Nikhil & Co’s sale of dishwashers to
Company G is computed using the TNMM as follows:

“Multiple Year Data” and Range Concept (vide amendment to Rule 10B of Income-tax Rules, 1962)
With a intent to align the Indian Transfer Pricing regulations with international best practices, by way of introduction
of “Range concept” and allowing the use of “Multiple Year data” for determining the arm’s length price, the
Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on October 19, 2015 has prescribed rules for applicability of range
concept and multiple year data. The rules would be applicable to international transaction or specified domestic
transaction entered into by taxpayers on or after April 1, 2014.
• The rules specify the use of current year data i.e. the year in which taxpayer has undertaken the
international transactions or specified domestic transactions (“SDT”) as the case may be has been
entered into, for the purpose of comparability analysis. However, in cases wherein current year data is
not available at the time of furnishing the return of income, data pertaining to up to two preceding
financial years may be used for comparability analysis.
• This would be applicable only in cases where Resale Price Method (“RPM”), Cost Plus Method (“CPLM”)
or Transactional Net Margin Method (“TNMM”) has been used as the most appropriate method for
computation of ALP.
• If at the time of audit proceedings, the data for the Current Year of the comparable transactions / enterprises
becomes available, then such data for the Current Year shall be used for determining the comparability
of an uncontrolled transaction(s) with the international transaction(s) or the SDT(s), even if the Current
Year data was not available at the time of filing of the return of income by the taxpayer.
Determination of Arms Length Price (“ALP”) where application of the most appropriate method result in
more than one price, the ALP shall be computed as follows:
• A dataset shall be constructed by placing the prices/data in an ascending order.
• If a comparable has been identified on the basis of data relating to:
A) Cureent Year, then the data for the immediately preceding two financial year can be considered,
provided the comparables has undertaken the same or similar comparable uncontrolled transaction
in those preceding two years.
B) Financial year immediately preceding the current year, then the data for the immediately preceding
two financial years can be considered, provided the comparables has undertaken the same or
similar comparable uncontrolled transaction in those preceding year.
The price in respect of comparable uncontrolled transaction shall be determined using the weighted average of
the prices/data for –
1. The current year and preceding two financial years or
2. Two financial years immediately preceding the current year
In accordance to the following :
• Where the prices have been determined using RPM, the weighted average of the prices shall be computed
with weights being assigned to the quantum of sales.

Lesson 14

Basic Concepts of International Taxation

649

• Where the prices have been determined using CUP, the weighted average of the prices shall be computed
with weights being assigned to the quantum of costs.
• Where the prices have been determined using TNMM, the weighted average of the prices shall be
computed with weights being assigned to the quantum of costs incurred or sales effected or assets
employed or as the case may be.

Application of the range concept
If the price at which the international transaction or specified domestic transaction is undertaken is within the
(thirty-fifth percentile to sixty-fifth percentile of the dataset), the transaction shall be deemed to be at the ALP.
However, if it is outside the range (mentioned above), the ALP of the transaction shall be taken to be the median
of the dataset.
• A minimum of six comparables would be required in the dataset for applying the concept of range.
• An arm’s length range beginning from the thirty-fifth percentile of the dataset (arranged in ascending
order) and ending on the sixty-fifth percentile will be considered.
The range concept would not be applied in cases where the most appropriate method delected for determining
the ALP is ‘profit split method’ or ‘other method.’
Further, if the dataset consists of less than six comparables, or the most appropriate method selected for
determining the ALP is profit aplit method or other method, the ALP will be determined based on the arithmetical
mean of all the prices / data included in the dataset. Further, the benefits of three percent variations which was
earlier permissible while adopting the arithmetic mean continues to be available.
Where during the course of any proceeding for the assessment of income, the Assessing Officer , on the basis
of material or information or document in his possession, is of the opinion that –
1. The price charged or paid in an international transaction or specified domestic transaction
been determined in accordance with Section 92C (1)/92C (2); or

has not

2. Any information and document relating to an international transaction or specified domestic transaction
have not been kept and maintained by the assessee in accordance with the provisions contained in
sub-section (1) of section 92D and the rules made in this behalf ; or
3. The information or data used in computation of the arm’s length price is not reliable or correct ; or
4. The assessee has failed to furnish, within the specified time, any information or document which he was
required to furnish by a notice issued under sub-section (3) of Section 92D.
In all such cases, the Assessing Officer may proceed to determine the arm’s length price in relation to the said
international transaction or specified domestic transaction in accordance with sub-sections (1) and (2), on the
basis of such material or information or document available with him. Provided that an opportunity of being
heard is to be given by assessing officer to Assessee by serving a notice calling upon him to show cause, on a
date and time to be specified in the notice, why the arm’s length price should not be so determined on the basis
of material or information or document in the possession of the Assessing Officer. Where an arm’s length price
is determined by assessing Officer under this Section, the Assessing Officer may re-compute the total Income of
the Assessee having regard to the arm’s length price so determined.
If Arm’s length price is determined by Assessing officer under this provision no deduction under section 10A or
section 10AA or section 10B or under Chapter VI-A shall be allowed in respect of the amount of income by which
the total income of the assessee is enhanced after computation of Income under this Section.
In this case, the income of other associated enterprises from which tax was deducted or deductible, shall not be
recomputed by reason of such determination of arm’s length price in the case of the first mentioned enterprise.

650 EP-TL&P

SELECTION OF TRANSFER PRICING METHOD
Rule 10C of the Indian Income Tax Rules, 1962 states that:
In selecting a most appropriate method, the following factors shall be taken into account namely,
(a) The nature and class of the international transaction or specified domestic transaction.
(b) The class or classes of Associated Enterprises entering into the transaction and the functions performed
by them taking into account assets employed or to be employed and risks assumed by such enterprises.
(c) The availability, coverage and reliability of data necessary for application of the method.
(d) The degree of comparability existing between the international transaction or specified domestic
transaction and the uncontrolled transaction and between the enterprises entering into such transactions.
(e) The extent to which reliable and accurate adjustments can be made to account for differences, if any,
between the international transaction or specified domestic transaction and the comparable uncontrolled
transactions or between the enterprises entering into such transactions.
(f) The nature, extent and reliability of assumptions required to be made in the application of a method.
The starting point to select the most appropriate method is the functional analysis which is necessary regardless
of what transfer pricing method is selected. Each method may require a deeper analysis focusing on aspects
relating to various methods. The functional analysis helps to:
– Identify and understand the intra-group transactions;
– Have a basis for comparability;
– Determine any necessary adjustments to the comparables;
– Check the accuracy of the method selected; and
– Over time, to consider adaptation of the policy if the functions, risks or assets have been modified.
Functional analysis also forms part of the documentation. The major components of a functional analysis
are:
1. Identification of Functions Performed : For the purpose of determining comparability, functions of the
entities play an important role.
2. Identification of Risk Undertaken : A risk-bearing party should have a chance of higher earnings than
a non-risk bearing party, and will incur the expenses and perhaps related loss if and when risk
materializes.
3. Identification of Assets used or contributed : The functional analysis must identify and distinguish
tangible assets and intangible assets as this is very important for functional analysis.
The functional analysis provides answers to identify which functions risks and assets are attributable to the
various related parties. In some cases one company may perform one function but the cost thereof is incurred/
paid by the other party to the transaction. The functional analysis could emphasize that situation. The functional
analysis includes reference to the industry specifics, the contractual terms of the transaction, the economics
circumstances and the business strategies. A checklist with columns for each related party and if needed for the
comparable parties could be used to summarize the functional analysis and give a quick idea of which party
performs each relevant function, uses what assets and bears which risk. But this short-cut overview should not
be used by tax auditors to count the number of enumerated functions, risks and assets in order to determine the
arm’s length compensation. It should be used to consider the relative importance of each function, risk and
asset. Once the functional analysis is performed and the functionality of the entity as regards the transactions

Lesson 14

Basic Concepts of International Taxation

651

subject to review (or the entity as a whole) has been completed, it can be determined what transfer pricing
method is most suitable to determine the arm’s length price for the transactions under the review (or the operating
margin for the entity under review).
There is no universally accepted method or model which describes the technique for choosing a transfer pricing
method. Traditionally comparable Uncontrolled Pricing Method, Profit Split Method, Resale Price Methods are
being used in transfer pricing. Other method as TNMM may also be used after the functional analysis and global
practices analysis.

REFERENCE TO TRANSFER PRICING OFFICER
Section 92CA of Income Tax Act deals with Reference to Transfer Pricing Officer by assessing officer.
It provides that Assessing Officer with prior approval of the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner may refer
the computation of Arm’s Length Price in an International Transaction or specified domestic transaction to transfer
pricing officer if he considers it necessary or expedient to do so. On reference by Assessing officer, Transfer
Pricing Officer (TPO) shall serve a notice to the Assessee requiring him to produce the evidence in support of
computation made by him of Arm’s Length Price in relation to an International transaction or specified domestic
transaction.

WHO IS TRANSFER PRICING OFFICER (TPO)
For the purpose of Section 92CA “Transfer Pricing Officer” means a Joint Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner
or Assistant Commissioner authorized by the Board to perform all or any of the functions of an Assessing Officer
specified in sections 92C and 92D in respect of any person or class of persons.

after considering such evidence as he may require on any specified points and after taking into account all
relevant materials which he has gathered, shall, by order in writing, determine the arm’s length price in relation
to the international transaction/specified domestic transaction and send a copy of his order to the Assessing
Officer and to the assessee. On receipt of the order from Transfer Pricing officer, the Assessing Officer shall
proceed to compute the total income of the assessee in conformity with the arm’s length price as determined by
the Transfer Pricing Officer.
Where a reference was made under sub-section (1) before the 1st day of June, 2007 but the order under subsection (3) has not been made by the Transfer Pricing Officer before the said date, or a reference under subsection (1) is made on or after the 1st day of June, 2007, an order under sub-section (3) may be made at any
time before sixty days prior to the date on which the period of limitation referred to in section 153, or as the case
may be, in section 153B for making the order of assessment or reassessment or recomputation or fresh

been extended accordingly.

Extension of time limit to Transfer Pricing Officer in certain cases
As per the existing provisions, the Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO) has to pass his order sixty days prior to the
date on which the limitation for making assessment expires. It is noted that at times seeking information from
foreign jurisdictions becomes necessary for determination of arm’s length price by the TPO and at times
proceedings before the TPO may also be stayed by a court order.

ADVANCE PRICING AGREEMENT (SECTION 92CC)
As per Section 92CC of Income Tax Act, 1961, w.e.f. 1st July, 2012, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (Board),
with the approval of the Central Government, may enter into an Advance Price Agreement with any person,
determining the arm’s length price or specifying the manner in which arm’s length price is to be determined, in
relation to an international transaction to be entered into by that person.
Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) is an agreement between a taxpayer and a taxing authority(Board) on an
appropriate transfer pricing methodology for fixing the arm’s length price for a set of transactions over a fixed
period of time in future. Importance of APA may be understood with the fact that in financial year 2011-2012,
addition of about ` 40,000 crore income has been proposed by Transfer pricing officers.

CALCULATION OF ARM’S LENGTH PRICE UNDER ADVANCE PRICING AGREEMENT
Arm’s Length Price under Advance Pricing Agreement shall be calculated as per method enumerated in section
92C (1) or any other method with such adjustment and variation as may be necessary and expedient so to do.
Section 92 C (1) of Income Tax Act prescribes that the arm’s length price in relation to an international transaction
shall be determined by any of the following methods, being the most appropriate method, having regard to the
nature of transaction or class of transaction or class of associated persons or functions performed by such
persons or such other relevant factors as the Board may prescribe (see rule 10B) namely:–
(a) Comparable uncontrolled price method;
(b) Resale price method;
(c) Cost plus method;
(d) Profit split method;
(e) Transactional net margin method;
(f) Such other method as may be prescribed by the Board.
Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 92C or Section 92CA, if the Advance Pricing Agreement has
been entered between an assessee and Board in respect of one international transaction, the arm’s length price
will be calculated as per the provisions of Advance Pricing Agreement.

654 EP-TL&P

VALIDITY OF ADVANCE PRICING AGREEMENT
The Advance Pricing Agreement shall be valid for a period as specified in the Advance Pricing Agreement.
However, this period will not be more than 5 consecutive previous years.

BINDINGNESS OF ADVANCE PRICING AGREEMENT
Advance Pricing Agreement shall be binding on:
(a) the person in whose case, and in respect of the transaction in relation to which, the agreement has been
entered into; and
(b) on the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner, and the income-tax authorities subordinate to him, in
respect of the said person and the said transaction
However the advance pricing agreement shall not be binding if there is a change in law or facts having bearing
on the agreement so entered.

DECLARING AN ADVANCE PRICING AGREEMENT VOID AB INITIO
The Board may, with the approval of the Central Government, by an order, declare an agreement to be void ab
initio, if it finds that the agreement has been obtained by the person by fraud or misrepresentation of facts.

EFFECT OF DECLARING AN ADVANCE PRICING AGREEMENT VOID AB INITIO
If an agreement is declared void ab initio –
(a) All the provisions of the Act shall apply to the person as if such agreement had never been entered into;
and
(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Act, for the purpose of computing any period of limitation
under this Act, the period beginning with the date of such agreement and ending on the date of order for
declaring an Advance Pricing Agreement void ab initio shall be excluded. Provided that where immediately
after the exclusion of the aforesaid period, the period of limitation, referred to in any provision of this Act,
is less than sixty days, such remaining period shall be extended to sixty days and the aforesaid period
of limitation shall be deemed to be extended accordingly.

ROLL BACK PROVISION IN ADVANCE PRICING AGREEMENT
Provisions relating to Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) were introduced in the Indian Income-tax Act, 1961
(the Act) with effect from 1 July 2012, vide Finance Act, 2012. These provisions did not then include rollback
provisions. The provision to provide for a rollback mechanism was brought into the Act vides Finance Act 2014
with effect from 1 October 2014. Thereafter, in March 2015, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) announced
detailed rules explaining the rollback provisions and the procedure for giving effect to them (the Rules).
Roll back is available for the roll back years, and a ‘roll back year’ has been defined to mean any previous year
falling within the period of four previous years, preceding the first previous year covered in the APA (i.e. the
regular APA).
For example — if the applicant files an APA application on or before 31 March 2015 covering a period of up to 5
years from financial year (FY) 2015-16 to FY 2019-20 and applies for a roll back, the roll back years can cover
the period from FY 2011- 12 to FY 2014-15. Similarly, if the applicant has filed an APA application covering a
period of 5 years from FY 2013-14 to FY 2017-18 and applies for a roll back, the roll back years can cover the
period from FY 2009-10 to FY 2012-13.

PROCEDURE AND SCHEME OF ADVANCE PRICING AGREEMENT
The Board may, for the purposes of this section, prescribe a scheme specifying therein the manner, form,

Lesson 14

Basic Concepts of International Taxation

655

procedure and any other matter generally in respect of the Advance Pricing Agreement. Where an application is
made by a person for entering into Advance Pricing Agreement, the proceeding shall be deemed to be pending
in the case of the person for the purposes of the Act.

FILING OF MODIFIED RETURN FOR ANY ASSESSMENT YEAR RELEVANT TO A PREVIOUS
YEAR TO WHICH APA APPLIES
As per Section 92CD of Income Tax Act, 1961, w.e.f. 1st July, 2012 notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in Section 139, where any person has entered into an agreement and prior to the date of entering into
the agreement, any return of income has been furnished under the provisions of Section 139 for any assessment
year relevant to a previous year to which such agreement applies, such person shall furnish, within a period of
three months from the end of the month in which the said agreement was entered into, a modified return in
accordance with and limited to the agreement. Save as otherwise provided in Section 92CD, if modified return
is furnished under Section 139, all other provision of the Act shall apply accordingly.
Thus, Section 92CD provides an opportunity to taxpayer to avoid the litigation even for the years for which return
has already been filed.
Reassessment of Total Income in the cases where Modified return has been filed but the Assessment/Reassessment
proceedings have been completed before the expiry of period allowed for furnishing of modified return
As per Section 92CD(3), if the assessment or reassessment proceedings for an assessment year relevant to a
previous year to which the agreement applies have been completed before the expiry of period allowed for
furnishing of modified return under Section 92CD , the Assessing Officer shall, in a case where modified return
is filed under this Section, proceed to assess or reassess or recompute the total income of the relevant assessment
year having regard to and in accordance with the agreement.
Application of APA in the pending assessment or reassessment for an assessment year relevant to the previous
year to which the agreement applies and modified return has been filed under Section 92 CD.
Where the assessment or reassessment proceedings for an assessment year relevant to the previous year to
which the agreement applies are pending on the date of filing of modified return in accordance with the provisions
of sub-section (1), the Assessing Officer shall proceed to complete the assessment or reassessment proceedings
in accordance with the agreement taking into consideration the modified return so furnished.
Extension of Limitation Period in the cases where modified return is filed under Section 92CD
As per Section 92CD (5), notwithstanding anything contained in Section 153 or Section 153B or Section 144C–
(a) The order of assessment, reassessment or recomputation of total income under Section 92CD (3) shall
be passed within a period of one year from the end of the financial year in which the modified return
under sub-section (1) is furnished;
(b) The period of limitation as provided in Section 153 or Section 153B or Section 144C for completion of
pending assessment or reassessment proceedings referred to Section 92CD(4) shall be extended by a
period of twelve months.
This may be observed from above provision that Advance Pricing Agreement, although styled as "advance"
agreements, may be a good arm in the resolution of transfer pricing issues pending from prior years–and in
some cases it can provide an effective means for resolving existing transfer pricing audits or adjustments.
By virtue of Advance Pricing Agreement, the taxpayer is assured about the Tax Liability arising out of International
transaction. No surprises or challenges will arise if the agreement is followed. The scope of certainty includes
tax treatment of covered transactions as to amount and characterization, elimination of potential penalties for
substantial tax understatement and a limitation of record-keeping requirements.

TRANSFER PRICING – DOCUMENTATION
The legal framework for maintenance of information and documentation by a taxpayer is provided in Section
92D of Income Tax Act, 1961 which lays down that every person who enters into an international transaction or
specified domestic transaction during a previous years shall maintain such information and documents , prescribed
by the Board, as will assist the Assessing Officer/ Transfer Pricing Officer to compute the income arising from
that transaction, having regard to the arm’s length price.
OECD in its transfer pricing guidelines stated that “Taxpayers should make reasonable efforts at the time the
transfer pricing is established to determine whether the transfer pricing is appropriate for tax purposes in
accordance with the arm’s length principle. Tax administrations should have the right to obtain the documentation
prepared or referred to in this process as means of verifying compliance with the arm’s length principle. Moreover,
the need for the documents should be balanced by the costs and the administrative burdens, particularly where
this process suggests the creation of documents that would not otherwise be prepared or referred to in the
absence of tax considerations.
Rule 10D(1) lays down thirteen different types of information and documents that a person has to keep and
maintain. Broadly, these information and documents may be classified into three types:
(i) Enterprise-wise documents – These are documents that describe the enterprise, the relationships with
other associated enterprise, the nature of business carried out, etc. This information is, largely, descriptive
[clauses (a) to (c)].
(ii) Transaction-specific documents – These are documents that explain the international transaction in
greater detail. It includes information with regard to each transaction (nature and terms of the contract,
etc.), description of the functions performed, assets employed and risks assumed by each party to the
transaction, economic and market analyses, etc. This information is both descriptive and quantitative in
nature [clauses (d) to (h)].
(iii) Computation related documents – These are documents which describe and detail the methods
considered, actual working assumptions, policies etc., adjustments made to transfer prices and any
other relevant information, data, document relied for determination of arm’s length price [clause (i) to
(m)].
The various types of information and documents to be maintained by the person in respect of an international
transaction or specified domestic transaction are prescribed in Rule 10(D) of the Income Tax Rules, as under:
(a) A description of the ownership structure of the enterprise and details of shares or other ownership
interest held therein by other enterprises;
(b) A profile of the multinational group of which the assessee enterprises i.e. taxpayer is a part and the
name, address, legal status and country of tax residence of each of the enterprises comprised in the
group with whom international transactions or specified domestic transactions, as the case may be
have been made by the taxpayer and the ownership linkages among them;
(c) A broad description of the business of the taxpayer and the industry in which it operates and the business
of the associated enterprises;
(d) The nature, terms and prices of international transaction or specified domestic transactions entered into
with each associated enterprise, details of property transferred or services provided and the quantum
and the value of each such transaction or class of such transaction;
(e) A description of the functions performed, risks assumed and assets employed or to be employed by the
taxpayer and by the associated enterprise involved in the international transaction or specified domestic
transactions;

Lesson 14

Basic Concepts of International Taxation

657

(f) A record of the economic and market analysis, forecasts, budgets or any other financial estimates
prepared by the taxpayer for its business as a whole or separately for each division or product which
may have a bearing on the international transaction or specified domestic transactions entered into by
the taxpayer;
(g) A record of uncontrolled transactions taken into account for analysing their comparability with the
international transaction or specified domestic transactions entered into, including a record of the nature,
terms and conditions relating to any uncontrolled transaction with third parties which may be relevant to
the pricing of the international transactions or or specified domestic transactions, as the case may be;
(h) A record of the analysis performed to evaluate comparability of uncontrolled transactions with the relevant
international transaction or specified domestic transactions;
(i) A description of the methods considered for determining the arm's length price in relation to each
international transaction or specified domestic transactions or class of transaction, the method selected
as the most appropriate method along with explanations as to why such method was so selected, and
how such method was applied in each case;
(j) A record of the actual working carried out for determining the arm's length price, including details of the
comparable data and financial information used in applying the most appropriate method and adjustments,
if any, which were made to account for differences between the international transaction or specified
domestic transactions and the comparable uncontrolled transactions or between the enterprises entering
into such transaction;
(k) The assumptions, policies and price negotiations if any which have critically affected the determination
of the arm's length price;
(l) Details of the adjustments, if any made to the transfer price to align it with arm's length price determined
under these rules and consequent adjustment made to the total income for tax purposes;
(m) Any other information, data or document, including information or data relating to the associated enterprise,
which may be relevant for determination of the arm's length price.
Rule 10D also prescribes that the above information is to be supported by authentic documents which may
include the following:
(a) Official publications, reports, studies and data bases of the government of the country of residence of
the associated enterprise or of any other country;
(b) Reports of market research studies carried out and technical publications of institutions of national or
international repute;
(c) Publications relating to prices including stock exchange and commodity market quotations;
(d) Published accounts and financial statements relating to the business of the associated enterprises;
(e) Agreements and contracts entered into with associated enterprises or with unrelated enterprises in
respect of transaction similar to the international transactions or specified domestic transactions, as the
case may be;
(f) Letters and other correspondence documenting terms negotiated between the taxpayer and associated
enterprise;
(g) Documents normally issued in connection with various transaction under the accounting practices followed.

BURDEN OF PROOF
It is noteworthy that the information and documentation requirements referred to above are linked to the burden
of proof laid on the taxpayer to prove that the transfer price adopted is in accordance with the arm's length
principle. One of the conditions to be fulfilled for discharging this burden by the taxpayer is maintenance of
prescribed information and documents in respect of an international transaction or specified domestic transactions

658 EP-TL&P
entered into with a associated enterprise. A default in maintaining information and documents in accordance
with the rules is one of the conditions which may trigger a transfer pricing audit under Section 92C(3). Any
default in respect of the documentation requirement may also attract penalty of a sum equal to two percent of
the value of the international transaction or specified domestic transactions entered by such person
(Sec 271AA).

SUBMISSION OF DOCUMENTS WITH THE TAX AUTHORITIES
There is no reference in the provisions included either in the Income Tax Act or the Income Tax Rules about any
requirement to submit the prescribed information and documents at the stage of initial compliance in the form of
submission of report under Section 92E. All that Section 92E requires is that the concerned taxpayer shall obtain
a Report from an Accountant in the prescribed form (Form 3CEB) and submit the Report by the specified date.
Form 3CEB contains a certificate from the Accountant that in his opinion proper information and documents as
prescribed have been maintained by the taxpayer. Rule 10D requires that the information and document
maintained should be contemporaneous as far as possible and should exist latest by the specified date for filing
the report under Section 92E. Section 92D also provides that information and documentation may be requisitioned
by the Assessing Officer or the Appellate Commissioner on a notice of thirty days which may be extended by
another period of 30 days.

NON APPLICABILITY OF DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENT
As per Rule 10D(2) of the Income tax rules, 1962 waived off the requirement of maintenance of information and
document in case of those person who has entered into an international transactions the aggregate value of
which, as recorded in the books of account does not exceeds 1 crores. However, the concerned taxpayer may
be required to substantiate on the basis of available material that the income arising from the international
transaction is computed in accordance with the arm’s length rule. Further, there is no exemption for such assessees
in obtaining and furnishing audit report under section 92E of the Act. i.e. even if the aggregate value of the
international transaction during the previous year is not exceeding 1 crore, the assesse is required to obtain and
furnish audit report.

RETENTION PERIOD OF DOCUMENTS KEPT UNDER RULE 10D
Rule 10D of the Income tax rules, 1962 states that the prescribed information and documents are required to be
maintained for a period of eight years from the end of the relevant Assessment years.
Section 92D(3) of the Act provides that the Assessing Officer or the Commissioner (Appeals) during the course
of any proceeding under the Act may require a person who has entered into an international transaction or
specified domestic transaction to furnish any information or document, which he was expected to maintain
under section 92D (1) and the person shall furnish such information or document called for within thirty days
from the date of receipt of a notice issued in this regard. However, if, for any reason, the person is unable to
produce the information or documents called for within the stipulated period of thirty days, the Assessing Officer
or Commissioner (Appeals) may, on an application made by the person, extend the period by a further period or
periods not exceeding, in all, thirty days.
Section 92E of the Act stated that every person who has entered into an international transaction or specified
domestic transaction during a previous year shall obtain a report from an accountant and furnish such report on
or before the specified date in the prescribed form duly signed and verified in the prescribed manner by such
accountant and setting forth such particulars as may be prescribed.
“Specified date” shall have the same meaning as assigned to due date in Explanation 2 below subsection (1) of
section 139 as per which, “In case of an assessee being a company, which is required to furnish a report
referred to in section 92E, the due date means the 30th day of November of the assessment year.”

Lesson 14

Basic Concepts of International Taxation

659

As per section 92F(i) “accountant” shall have the same meaning as in the Explanation below sub-section (2) of
section 288 as per which “Accountant means a chartered accountant within the meaning of Chartered Accountants
Act, 1949 (38 of 1949) and includes, in relation to any State, any person, who by virtue of the provisions of subsection (2) of section 226 of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956), is entitled to be appointed to act as an
Accountant of companies registered in that State.”.

BEPS action plan - Country-By-Country Report and Master file
Sections 92 to 92F of the Act contain provisions relating to transfer pricing regime. Under provision of section
92D, there is requirement for maintenance of prescribed information and document relating to the international
transaction and specified domestic transaction.
The OECD report on Action 13 of BEPS Action plan provides for revised standards for transfer pricing
documentation and a template for country-by-country reporting of income, earnings, taxes paid and certain
measure of economic activity. India has been one of the active members of BEPS initiative and part of international
consensus. It is recommended in the BEPS report that the countries should adopt a standardised approach to
transfer pricing documentation. A three-tiered structure has been mandated consisting of:i. a master file containing standardised information relevant for all multinational enterprises (MNE) group
members;
ii. a local file referring specifically to material transactions of the local taxpayer; and
iii. a country-by-country report containing certain information relating to the global allocation of the MNE’s
income and taxes paid together with certain indicators of the location of economic activity within the
MNE group
The report mentions that taken together, these three documents (country-by-country report, master file and
local file) will require taxpayers to articulate consistent transfer pricing positions and will provide tax administrations
with useful information to assess transfer pricing risks. It will facilitate tax administrations to make determinations
about where their resources can most effectively be deployed, and, in the event audits are called for, provide
information to commence and target audit enquiries.
The country-by-country report requires multinational enterprises (MNEs) to report annually and for each tax
jurisdiction in which they do business; the amount of revenue, profit before income tax and income tax paid and
accrued. It also requires MNEs to report their total employment, capital, accumulated earnings and tangible
assets in each tax jurisdiction. Finally, it requires MNEs to identify each entity within the group doing business in
a particular tax jurisdiction and to provide an indication of the business activities each entity engages in. The
Country-by-Country (CbC) report has to be submitted by parent entity of an international group to the prescribed
authority in its country of residence. This report is to be based on consolidated financial statement of the group.
The master file is intended to provide an overview of the MNE groups business, including the nature of its global
business operations, its overall transfer pricing policies, and its global allocation of income and economic activity
in order to assist tax administrations in evaluating the presence of significant transfer pricing risk. In general, the
master file is intended to provide a high-level overview in order to place the MNE group’s transfer pricing practices
in their global economic, legal, financial and tax context. The master file shall contain information which may not
be restricted to transaction undertaken by a particular entity situated in particular country. In that aspect, information
in master file would be more comprehensive than the existing regular transfer pricing documentation. The master
file shall be furnished by each entity to the tax authority of the country in which it operates.
In order to implement the international consensus, it is proposed to provide a specific reporting regime in respect
of CbC reporting and also the master file. It is proposed to include essential elements in the Act while remaining
aspects can be detailed in rules. The elements relating to CbC reporting requirement and matters related to it
proposed to be included through amendment of the Act are:—

660 EP-TL&P
i. the reporting provision shall apply in respect of an international group having consolidated revenue
above a threshold to be prescribed.
ii. the parent entity of an international group, if it is resident in India shall be required to furnish the report
in respect of the group to the prescribed authority on or before the due date of furnishing of return of
income for the Assessment Year relevant to the Financial Year (previous year) for which the report is
being furnished;
iii. the parent entity shall be an entity which is required to prepare consolidated financial statement under
the applicable laws or would have been required to prepare such a statement, had equity share of any
entity of the group been listed on a recognized stock exchange in India;
iv. every constituent entity in India, of an international group having parent entity that is not resident in
India, shall provide information regarding the country or territory of residence of the parent of the
international group to which it belongs. This information shall be furnished to the prescribed authority on
or before the prescribed date;
v. the report shall be furnished in prescribed manner and in the prescribed form and would contain
aggregate information in respect of revenue, profit & loss before Income-tax, amount of Income-tax
paid and accrued, details of capital, accumulated earnings, number of employees, tangible assets

constituent’s residential status, nature and detail of main business activity and any other information
as may be prescribed. This shall be based on the template provided in the OECD BEPS report on
Action Plan 13;
vi. an entity in India belonging to an international group shall be required to furnish CbC report to the
prescribed authority if the parent entity of the group is resident ;a. in a country with which India does not have an arrangement for exchange of the CbC report; or
b. such country is not exchanging information with India even though there is an agreement; and
c. this fact has been intimated to the entity by the prescribed authority
vii. If there are more than one entities of the same group in India, then the group can nominate (under
intimation in writing to the prescribed authority) the entity that shall furnish the report on behalf of the
group. This entity would then furnish the report;

92CB. Power of Board to make safe harbour rules.
The determination of arm’s length price under section 92C or section 92CA shall be subject to safe harbour rules
as prescribed under section 92CB of the Act. The term “Safe Harbour means “circumstances under which the
income-tax authorities shall accept the transfer pricing declared by the assessee.” The Rule provides minimum
operating profit margin in relation to operating expenses a taxpayer is expected to earn for certain categories of
international transactions or specified domestic transfer pricing , that will acceptable to the income tax authorities
as arm’s length price (ALP) . The rule also provides acceptable norms for certain categories of financial transactions
such as intra-group loans made or guarantees provided to non-resident affiliates of an Indian tax payers. The
safe harbor rules, optional for a taxpayer, contains the conditions and circumstances under which norms /
margins would be accepted by the tax authorities and the related compliance obligations.
Safe harbours carry certain benefits which are described below:
• Compliance Simplicity: Safe harbours tend to substitute simplified requirements in place of existing
regulations, thereby reducing compliance burden and associated costs for eligible taxpayers, who would
otherwise be obligated to dedicate resources and time to collect, analyze and maintain extensive data
to support their inter-company transactions.
• Certainty & Reduce Litigation: Electing safe harbours may grant a greater sense of assurance to
taxpayers regarding acceptability of their transfer price by the tax authorities without onerous audits.
This conserves administrative and monetary resources for both the taxpayer and the tax administration.
• Administrative Simplicity: Since tax administrations would be required to carry out only a minimal
examination in respect of taxpayers opting for safe harbours, they can channelize their efforts to examine
more complex and high-risk transactions and taxpayers.

Filling of form 3CEFA / 3CEFB
Any taxpayer who has entered into an eligible international transaction or specified domestic transaction and
who wishes to exercise the option to be governed by the safe harbour rules is required to file a specified form
(Form 3CEFA for International Transaction or Form 3CEFB for SDT). Form 3CEFA / 3CEFB requires the taxpayer
to declare the following:
• Transaction entered with an AE is an eligible international transaction or specified domestic transaction;
• Quantum of the international transaction specified domestic transaction;
• Whether the AEs country or territory is a no tax or low tax country or territory; and
• Operating profit margin/transfer price.

664 EP-TL&P

LESSON ROUND UP
Tax Haven: A Tax Haven is a place where there is no tax on income or it is taxed at low rate. Individuals or
corporate entities move from jurisdiction of high rates of taxes to the region of low tax in order to lower their
overall tax liability.
Factors for determining whether a country is tax haven or not are: Nil or Nominal tax Rate, No Exchange
of Information, Lack of Transparency, Limited Regulatory supervision.
Controlled foreign Corporation: The OECD recommended for adoption of CFCs Rules for taxing those
entities which defer the tax liability after moving to the tax haven country. A CFC is a legal entity that exists in
one jurisdiction but is owned or controlled primarily by taxpayers of a different jurisdiction. The CFC rules
may also be termed ‘anti-deferral rules’.
Sub Part F means special category of foreign source unearned income that is currently taxed by the Internal
Revenue Code, 1986 of US whether or not it is remitted to the U.S. It is basically U.S. financial term used for
the U.S. based institutions.
Residency Issue : Residence as defined in double taxation treaties is different from residence as defined for
domestic tax purposes. The situation of double taxation will arise where the income gets taxed in two or more
than two countries whether due to residency or source principle as the case may be. The problem of double
taxation arises if the income of a person is taxed in one country on the basis of residence and on the basis of
residency in another country or on the basis of both.
Permanent Establishment: as per the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements, PE includes, a wide variety
of arrangements i.e. a place of management, a branch, an office, a factory, a workshop or a warehouse, a
mine, a quarry, an oilfield etc. Imposition of tax on a foreign enterprise is done only if it has a PE in the
contracting state.
Transfer Pricing Provisions in India: The Finance Act, 2001 introduced law of transfer pricing in India
through Sections 92 to 92F of the Income Tax Act, 1961 which guides computation of the transfer price and
suggests detailed documentation procedures.
Arm’s length price means fair price of goods transferred or services rendered. In other words, the transfer
price should represent the price which could be charged from an independent party in uncontrolled conditions.
Arm’s length price calculation is very important for a company.
Associated Enterprises has been defined in Section 92A of the Act. It prescribes that “associated enterprise”,
in relation to another enterprise, means an enterprise –
(a) Which participates, directly or indirectly, or through one or more intermediaries, in the management or
control or capital of the other enterprise; or
(b) In respect of which one or more persons who participate, directly or indirectly, or through one or more
intermediaries, in its management or control or capital, are the same persons who participate, directly
or indirectly, or through one or more intermediaries, in the management or control or capital of the
other enterprise.
“International Transaction” means a transaction between two or more associated enterprises, either or both
of whom are non-residents, in the nature of purchase, sale or lease of tangible or intangible property, or
provision of services, or lending or borrowing money, or any other transaction having a bearing on the profits,
income, losses or assets of such enterprises, and shall include a mutual agreement or arrangement between
two or more associated enterprises for the allocation or apportionment of, or any contribution to, any cost or
expense incurred or to be incurred in connection with a benefit, service or facility provided or to be provided
to any one or more of such enterprises.

Specified Domestic transactions: Finance Act, 2012 has made a very important change and it has extended
the applicability of Transfer Pricing Provisions to specified domestic transaction w.e.f. 1st April, 2012.
Methods for determination of Arm’s Length Price: Section 92C of Income Tax Act defines the methods
which are to be used in determination of Arm's Length prices for International Transaction and specified
domestic transaction.
(A) Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method (CUP)
(B) Resale Price Method (RPM)
(C) Cost Plus Method (CPM)
(D) Profit Split Method (PSM)
(E) Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM)
(F) Such other method as may be prescribed by the Board.
Reference to TPO: Section 92CA of Income Tax Act deals with Reference to Transfer Pricing Officer by
assessing officer. It provides that Assessing Officer with prior approval of the Principal Commissioner
Commissioner may refer the computation of Arm’s Length Price in an International Transaction to transfer
pricing officer if he considers it necessary or expedient to do so.
Advance Pricing Agreement: As per Section 92CC of Income Tax Act, 1961, w.e.f. 1st July, 2012, the
Central Board of Direct Taxes (Board), with the approval of the Central Government, may enter into an
Advance Price Agreement with any person, determining the arm’s length price or specifying the manner in
which arm’s length price is to be determined, in relation to an international transaction to be entered into by
that person. Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) is an agreement between a taxpayer and a taxing
authority(Board) on an appropriate transfer pricing methodology for fixing the arm’s length price for a set of
transactions over a fixed period of time in future.
Documentation: The legal framework for maintenance of information and documentation by a taxpayer is
provided in Section 92D of Income Tax Act, 1961 which lays down that every person who enters into an
international transaction or specified domestic transactions shall maintain prescribed information and
documents.
Certificate: Form 3CEB contains a certificate from the Accountant that in his opinion proper information and
documents as prescribed have been maintained by the taxpayer.
Penalty: Contravention of Transfer Pricing provisions as contained in Chapter X of the Income tax Act, 1961
may invite hefty penalties.

retired judge of the Supreme Court has been
set-up. There are two members in the body. AAR
is empowered to give rulings, which are binding
both on the Income-tax Department and the

In order to provide the facility of ascertaining the Income-tax liability of a non-resident, to plan their
Income-tax affairs well in advance and to avoid long drawn and expensive litigation, a scheme of
Advance Ruling has been introduced under the Income-tax Act, 1961. A non-resident or certain
categories of resident can obtain binding rulings from the Authority for advance Ruling on question
of law or fact arising out of any transaction/proposed transactions which are relevant for the
determination of his tax liability.

CONCEPT OF ADVANCE RULING
With a view to avoid a disputes in respect of assessment of income-tax liability in the case of a ‘Non-Resident’,
a Scheme of Advance Ruling has been introduced by incorporating Chapter XIX-B in the Income Tax Act, 1961
by the Finance Act, 1993. Section 245N to 245V of the Income Tax Act, provides a scheme for giving advance
rulings in respect of transactions involving non-residents and certain residents with a view to avoid needless
litigation and promoting better relations with the tax payer. The Scheme enables the ‘Non-Residents’ to obtain
in advance, a binding ruling from the Authority for Advance Rulings on issues, which could arise in determining
their tax liabilities.
The term advance ruling has been defined in section 245N of the Act. “Advance ruling” means,
(i) a determination by the Authority in relation to a transaction which has been undertaken or is proposed
to be undertaken by a non-resident applicant; or
(ii) a determination by the Authority in relation to the tax liability of a non-resident arising out of a transaction
which has been undertaken or is proposed to be undertaken by a resident applicant with such nonresident; or
(iia) a determination by the Authority in relation to the tax liability of a resident applicant, arising out of a
transaction which has been undertaken or is proposed to be undertaken by such applicant, and
such determination shall include the determination of any question of law or of fact specified in the
application;
(iii) a determination or decision by the Authority in respect of an issue relating to computation of total income
which is pending before any income-tax authority or the Appellate Tribunal and such determination or
decision shall include the determination or decision of any question of law or of fact relating to such
computation of total income specified in the application;
(iv) a determination or decision by the Authority whether an arrangement, which is proposed to be undertaken
by any person being a resident or a non-resident, is an impermissible avoidance arrangement as referred
to in Chapter X-A or not
Further, advance ruling may be determined for both the question of law or fact.

WHO CAN SEEK ADVANCE RULING?
As per Section 245N(b) of the Income Tax Act, the advance ruling under the income-tax act could be sought by:
(a) A non-resident.
(b) Resident having transactions with non-residents.
(c) Resident referred to in sub-clause (iia) of section 245N(a) above falling within any such class or category
of person as the Central Government may be notification in the Official Gazette specify.
(d) Specified categories of residents.
(e) A resident or non-resident who makes an application under section 245Q(1) in respect of impermissible
avoidance arrangement.

AUTHORITY FOR ADVANCE RULING (SECTION 245-O)
Under the scheme of Advance Ruling, the power of giving advance rulings has been entrusted by the Central
Government to an independent adjudicatory body designated, as Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR).
The Authority shall consist of a Chairman and such number of Vice-chairmen, revenue Members and law Members
as the Central Government may, by notification, appoint.

Lesson 15

672 EP-TL&P
records can also be obtained from the Commissioner. In cases, where the applicants are not existing assesses,
sometimes it becomes difficult to determine as to which Commissioner would have jurisdiction over the case
of the applicant. In such cases, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) is to be requested under Rule 13(1)
of the Procedure Rules to designate a Commissioner in respect of an applicant within two weeks. The

and submissions of the applicant.
Section 254R(2) of the Income Tax Act provides that the Authority may, after examining the application and the
records called for, either ‘allow’ or ‘reject’ the application. The word ‘allow has been used synonymously with
‘admit’. In other words, after examining the records, the Authority either admits or rejects the application. In case
Authority has admitted the application, it is empowered to collect or received additional material and it will
examine all the material thus available to it at the time of hearing and pronouncing a ruling on the application. In
case the application has be rejected then an opportunity of being heard must be given to the assessee.
Further, where the application is rejected, reasons for such rejection shall be given in the order and a copy of
every order shall be sent to the applicant and to the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner. And where an

opportunity to the applicant of being heard, either in person or through a duly authorised representative.
The authority shall pass the ruling in writing within six months of the receipt of application and the copy of the
order thereof, shall be sent to the commissioner and assessee.
A copy of the advance ruling pronounced by the Authority, duly signed by the Members and certified in the
prescribed manner shall be sent to the applicant and to the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner, as soon
as may be, after such pronouncement.

Customs Act, 1962.
(b) Must relate to a transaction entered into or proposed to be entered into by the applicant.
(c) Questions on which ruling can be sought :
(i) Even though the word used in the definition is singular namely “question”, it is clear that there can
be more than one question in one application. This has been made amply clear by Column No.8 of
the Form of application for obtaining an advance ruling (Form No.34C).
(ii) a question can be both of law or fact, pertaining to the income tax liability of the non-resident qua the
transaction undertaken or proposed to be undertaken.
(iii) The questions may be on points of law as well as on facts or could be mixed questions of law and
facts. There should be so drafted that each question is capable of an answer. This may need
breaking-up of complex questions into two or more simple questions.
(iv) The questions should arise out of the statement of facts given with the application. No ruling will be
given on a purely hypothetical question. Question not specified in the application can be raised
during the course of hearing. Normally a question is not allowed to be amended but in deserving
cases AAR may allow amendment of one or more questions.
(v) Subject to the limitations to be presently referred to, the question may relate to any aspect of the
non-resident’s liability including international aspects and aspects governed by double tax avoidance

Lesson 15

Advance Ruling and GAAR

673

agreements. The questions may even cover aspects of allied laws that may have a bearing on tax
liability such as the law of contracts, the law of trusts etc., but the question must have a direct
bearing, on and nexus with the interpretation of the Indian Income-tax Act.
Authority shall not allow the application where the question raised in the application, –
i. is already pending before any income-tax authority or Appellate Tribunal [except in the case of a resident
applicant falling in sub-clause (iii) of clause (b) of section 245N] or any court;
ii. involves determination of fair market value of any property;
iii. relates to a transaction or issue which is designed prima facie for the avoidance of income-tax [except
in the case of a resident applicant falling in sub-clause (iii) of clause (b) of section 245N or in the case of
an applicant falling in sub-clause (iiia) of clause (b) of section 245N:

POWERS OF THE ADVANCE RULING AUTHORITY
Section 245U deals with the Powers of the Authority. Sub-section (1) provides that for the purpose of exercising
its powers, the Authority shall have all the powers of a Civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of
1908) as are referred to in Section 131 of the Income-tax Act, when trying a suit in respect of the following
matters, namely :
(a) Discovery and inspection;
(b) Enforcing the attendance of any person, including any officer of a banking company and examining him
on oath;
(c) Compelling the production of books of account and other documents; and
(d) Issuing commissions.
Under sub-section (2), the Authority shall be deemed to be a Civil Court for the purposes of Section 195 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure. Section 195 deals with ‘Prosecution for contempt of lawful authority of public
servants, for offences against public justice and for offences relating to documents given in evidence’. But it
would not be deemed to be a Court for the purposes of Chapter XXVI of the Code of Criminal Procedure which
deals with ‘Provisions as to offences affecting the administration of justice’. Further, every proceeding before the
authority shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of Sections 193 and 228, and for the
purpose of Section 196 of the Indian Penal Code. Section 193 deals with punishment for false evidence and the
same is reproduced below :
“193 : Whoever intentionally gives false evidence in any stage of a judicial proceeding, or fabricates false
evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of a judicial proceeding, shall be punished with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine;
and whoever intentionally gives or fabricates false evidence in any other case, shall be published with
imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to fine.”
Section 228 of the Indian Penal Code deals with intentional insult or interruption to public servant sitting in
judicial proceeding and the same is reproduced as below:
“228 : Whoever intentionally offers any insult, or causes any interruption to any public servant, while such
public servant is sitting in any stage of a judicial proceeding, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for
a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both”.
Section 196 of the I.P.C. deals with ‘using evidence known to be false’ and is set-out as follows :
“196 : Whoever corruptly uses or attempts to use as true or genuine evidence any evidence which he knows
to be false or fabricated, shall be punished in the same manner as if he gave or fabricated false evidence.”.
Thus, the authority would have all the powers of the Civil Court for the purposes of dealing with intentional insult,
false evidence etc.

APPLICABILITY OF ADVANCE RULING (SECTION 245-S)
The advance ruling pronounced by the Authority under Section 245R shall be binding only :
(a) On the applicant who had sought it;
(b) In respect of the transactions in relation to which the ruling had been sought; and
(c) On the Principal Commissioner or Commissioner, and the income-tax authorities subordinate to him, in
respect of the applicant and the said transaction.”
The advance ruling shall be binding as aforesaid unless there is a change in law or facts on the basis of which
the advance ruling has been pronounced.
The effect of the ruling is, understandably, stated to be confined to the applicant who has sought it as well as the
Principal Commissioner or Commissioner and the income-tax authority subordinate to him having jurisdiction
over the case and that too only in relation to transaction for which advance ruling was sought. It may, however,
be stated that the Authority generally follows the ruling in other cases on materially similar facts and, most
certainly in other cases raising the same question of law, if any, which it has decided. The rule here is different
from the position in other countries where either the taxpayer or the revenue or both are at liberty to accept the
ruling or not.

ADVANCE RULING TO BE VOID IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES
As per Section 245T, where the Authority finds, on a representation made to it by the Principal Commissioner or
Commissioner or otherwise, that an advance ruling pronounced by it under sub-section (6) of section 245R has
been obtained by the applicant by fraud or misrepresentation of facts, it may, by order, declare such ruling to be
void ab initio and thereupon all the provisions of this Act shall apply (after excluding the period beginning with the
date of such advance ruling and ending with the date of order under this sub-section) to the applicant as if such
advance ruling had never been made. A copy of such order made shall be sent to the applicant and the Principal
Commissioner or Commissioner.

QUESTION PRECLUDED
Under Section 254R, certain restrictions have been imposed on the admissibility of an application for advance
ruling, if the question concerned is pending before other authorities. According to it, the authority shall not allow
an application where the question raised by the non-resident applicant (or a resident applicant having transaction
with a non-resident) is already pending before any income-tax authority or appellate tribunal or any court of law.
However, exception has been provided in cases of resident applicants falling in sub-clause (iii) of Clause (b) of
Section 245N in cases of pending before income tax authorities or the Tribunal. Further, the authority shall not
allow the application where the question raised in it:
(i) Involves determination of fair market value of any property; or
(ii) It relates to a transaction or issue which is designed prima facie for the avoidance of income-tax.

THE BENEFITS OF OBTAINING AN ADVANCE RULING
Obtaining an Advance Ruling:
1. Helps non-residents in planning their income tax affairs well in advance;
2. Brings certainty in determination of the tax liability;
3. Helps in avoiding long drawn litigation; and
4. It is relatively inexpensive, expeditious and binding.

Lesson 15

Advance Ruling and GAAR

675

GENERAL ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES (GAAR)
GAAR is an anti avoidance measure which empowers tax authorities to call a business arrangement or a
transaction ‘impermissible avoidance arrangement’ and thereby denying tax benefits to the parties. Avoidance
is legal provision which allows investors to legally reduce their tax liability. GAAR is a concept which generally
empowers the Revenue Authorities in a country to deny the tax benefits of transactions or arrangements which
do not have any commercial substance or consideration other than achieving the tax benefit. Whenever revenue
authorities question such transactions, there is a conflict with the tax payers. Thus, different countries started
making rules so that tax cannot be avoided by such transactions. Australia introduced such rules way back in
1981. Later on countries like Germany, France, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa etc too opted for GAAR.

GAAR IN INDIA
In India, the real discussions on GAAR came to light with the release of draft Direct Taxes Code Bill (popularly
known as DTC 2009) on 12th August, 2009. It contained the provisions for GAAR. Later on the revised Discussion
Paper was released in June 2010, followed by tabling in the Parliament on 30th August, 2010, a formal Bill to
enact the law known as the Direct Taxes Code 2010.
Concept of avoidance has been an area of debate and Supreme Court in the latest Vodafone judgment has held
it to be valid provided it is allowed by the law and also opining that India has room to enact GAAR. Introduction
of GAAR was announced in the Finance Act 2012. And the first draft of GAAR when published received heavy
criticism and thereby Shome committee was formed to come up with recommendations and guidelines. The
instant paper discusses ramification of GAAR into two parts. First part discusses the ramifications of first draft of
GAAR in a general manner without going into detail and second part discusses the ramifications of
recommendations given by the Shome committee. The introduction of GAAR is inevitable but it has to be
reasonable to facilitate conducive investment environment. As per the final recommendations of expert committee
on GAAR, GAAR needs to be deferred for 3 years upto A.Y 2016-17
Many provisions of GAAR have been criticised by various people. However, the basic criticism of GAAR provisions
is that it is considered to be too sweeping in nature and there was a fear (considering poor record of IT authorities
in India) that Assessing Officers will apply these provisions in a routine manner (or read misuse) and harass the
general honest tax payer too. There is only a fine distinction between Tax Avoidance and Tax Mitigation, as any
arrangement to obtain a tax benefit can be considered as an impermissible avoidance arrangement by the
assessing officer. Thus, there was a hue and cry to put checks and balances in place to avoid arbitrary application
of the provisions by the assessing authorities. It was felt that there is a need for further legislative and administrative
safeguards and at least a minimum threshold limit for invoking GAAR should be introduced so that small time tax
payers are not harassed.

DEFERMENT OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO GAAR (BY FINANCE ACT, 2015)
The existing provisions of the General Anti Avoidance Rule (GAAR) introduced by the Finance Act, 2013 are
contained in Chapter X-A (consisting of section 95 to 102) and section 144BA of the Act. Chapter X-A provides
the substantive provision of GAAR whereas section 144BA provides the procedure to be undertaken for invoking
GAAR and passing of the assessment order in consequence of GAAR provisions being invoked.
As provided in the Finance Act, 2013, the aforementioned provisions of Chapter X-A and section 144BA were to
come into effect from 1.04.2016. These provisions, therefore, would have been applicable to the income of the
financial year 2015-16 (Assessment Year 2016-17) and subsequent years.
However, several concerns regarding certain aspects of GAAR were expressed because of which the Government
reviewed the implementation of GAAR provisions. The Government noted India is an active participant to the
ongoing project Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) under Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) and the report on various aspects of BEPS and recommendations regarding the measures

676 EP-TL&P
to counter it are still awaited. Therefore, Government decided that it would be proper that GAAR provisions are
implemented as part of a comprehensive regime to deal with BEPS and aggressive tax avoidance. Accordingly,
By Finance Act, 2015, implementation of GAAR is deferred by two years and GAAR provisions will now be made
applicable to the income of the financial year 2017-18 (Assessment Year 2018-19) and subsequent years.
Further, investments made up to 31.03.2017 shall remain protected from the applicability of GAAR by amendment
in the relevant rules in this regard. This amendment is effective from 1st April, 2015.

GAAR versus SAAR
In addition to GAAR there also exists SAAR- Specific Anti-Avoidance Rules which specifically aim at certain
arrangements of tax avoidance. SAAR have many points to its favour, since its specific there is no scope of
confusion, it doesn’t provide taxation authorities any discretion and from the point of view of tax payer it provides
certainty regarding the nature of his arrangement. Provisions of SAAR are there in Chapter X of the Income Tax
Act 1961 and some of the provisions pertaining to SAAR are in various other chapters of Income Tax Act.

LESSON ROUND UP
– The concept of advance rulings under the Act was introduced by the Finance Act, 1993, Chapter XIXB of the Act, which deals with advance rulings, came into force with effect from 1.6.1993. Under the
scheme, the power of giving advance rulings has been entrusted to an independent adjudicatory
body designated, as Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR).
– Who can seek advance ruling: As per Section 245N(b) of the Income Tax Act, the advance ruling
under the income-tax act could be sought by :
– A non-resident;
– Resident having transactions with non-residents.
– Resident;
– Specified categories of residents.
– Resident or non-residents who makes an application in respect of impermissible avoidance arrangement

– Application for advance ruling: An applicant shall make an application in such form and in such

manner as may be prescribed, stating the question on which the advance ruling is sought. The
application shall be made in quadruplicate and be accompanied by a fee of ten thousand.

– Powers of authority: Section 245U deals with the Powers of the Authority. Sub-section (1) provides that

for the purpose of exercising its powers, the Authority shall have all the powers of a Civil Court under the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) as are referred to in Section 131 of the Income-tax Act.

– Applicability of advance ruling :The advance ruling pronounced by the Authority under Section
245R shall be binding only :

– On the applicant who had sought it;
– In respect of the transactions in relation to which the ruling had been sought; and
– On the Commissioner, and the income-tax authorities subordinate to him, in respect of the applicant
and the said transaction.
– GAAR is an anti avoidance measure which empowers tax authorities to call a business arrangement
or a transaction ‘impermissible avoidance arrangement’ and thereby denying tax benefits to the parties.

Answer

1.

Where an undisclosed income in the form of
investment in asset is declared under the
Scheme and tax, surcharge and penalty is
paid on the fair market value of the asset as
on 01.06.2016, then will the declarant be
liable for capital gains on sale of such asset in
the future? If yes, then how will the capital
gains in such case be computed?

Yes, the declarant will be liable for capital gains under
the Income-tax Act on sale of such asset in future.
However, since the asset will be taxed at its fair market
value, the cost of acquisition for the purpose of Capital
Gains shall be the fair market value as on 01.06.2016
and the period of holding shall start from the said date
(i.e. the date of determination of FMV for the purposes
of the Scheme).

2.

Where a notice under section 142(1)/143(2)/
148/ 153A/ 153C of the Income-tax Act has

declaration under the Scheme?

The person will only be ineligible from declaration for
those assessment years for which a notice under
section 142(1)/143(2)/148/153A/153C is issued and the
proceeding is pending before the Assessing Officer.

declared under the Scheme is made before
30.11.2016, then whether the entire

paid remains valid?

2.

In case of amalgamation or in case of

amalgamated entity/LLP or in the name of
the amalgamating company or company
existing prior to conversion into LLP?

Since the amalgamating company or the company prior
to conversion into LLP is no more into existence and
the assets/liabilities of such erstwhile entities have been
taken over by the amalgamated company/LLP, the
declaration is to be made in the name of the
amalgamated company or the LLP, as the case may
be, for the year in which the amalgamation/conversion
takes place.

eligible to avail the Scheme in respect of assessment
years for which notice under section 153A can be
issued.

Questions

Answer

1.

Can a declaration made under the Scheme
be revised before the date of closure of the
Scheme i.e. 30.09.2016?

It is expected that the declarations made under the
Scheme are filed correctly. However, a revised
declaration can be filed on or before the date of
closure of the Scheme provided the undisclosed income
in the revised declaration is not less than the
undisclosed income declared in the declaration already
filed.

2.

If an undisclosed income represented in the
form of an asset or otherwise pertains to a
year falling beyond the time limit allowed
under section 149 of the Income-tax Act,
1961 and the said undisclosed income is
not declared under the Scheme, then as per
the provisions of section 197(c) of the
Finance Act, 2016, the said undisclosed
income shall be treated as the income of the
year in which a notice under section 148 of
the Income-tax Act has been issued. The
said provision is inconsistent with the
existing time lines provided under the
Income-tax Act for reopening a case. Please
clarify?

Question No. 4 of Circular No. 24 of 2016 may be
referred where the tax treatment of such income has
been clarified. Since the Scheme contained in Chapter
IX of the Finance Act, 2016 is a later law in time, the
provisions of the Scheme shall prevail over the
provisions of earlier laws.

3.

The declaration made in respect of cash,
investment etc. under the Scheme would
result in increase in capital in the Balance
Sheet in extra ordinary manner. Whether
such cases of the declarants would be
selected for scrutiny under the CASS for
this reason?

The cases of the declarant shall not be selected for
scrutiny under the CASS only on the ground that there
is increase in capital in the balance sheet as a result of
the declaration made under the Scheme.

4.

In a case where the declarant gets the
benami asset transferred in his name without
payment of any monetary consideration to
the benamidar, whether capital gains would
be chargeable in the hands of benamidar
consequent upon such transfer and whether
the tax at source @ 1% would be deducted
in such case?

In this case the consideration for acquisition of benami
property has already been paid by the beneficial owner
and the fair market value of the property has been
declared by the beneficial owner under the Scheme.
Since, the transfer of property from benamidar to
beneficial owner is only to regularize and there will be
no involvement of monetary consideration for transfer
of immovable property by the benamidar in the name

Other Amendment vide Finance Act, 2016

687

of the declarant, the question of capital gains in the
hands of benamidar and deduction of tax at source
thereon shall not arise.
5.

Under what provision can a declarant be
sure that the information contained in a
valid declaration shall not be shared with
any other law enforcement agency and also
shall not be shared within the income-tax
department for investigation?

Section 195 of the Act provides that provisions of
section 138 of the Income-tax Act shall apply in relation
to the proceedings under the Scheme. Vide notification
S.O. 2322(E) dated 06.07.2016, an order has been
passed by the Central Government directing that no
public servant shall produce before any person or
authority any such document or record or any
information or computerized data or part thereof as
comes into his possession during the discharge of
official duties in respect of a valid declaration made
under the Scheme.

6.

With reference to question No. 5 issued
vide Circular No. 25 of 2016, wherein it has
been stated that the department will not
make any enquiry in respect of sources of
income, payment of tax, surcharge and
penalty, it may be clarified that whether the
payment under the Scheme can be made
out of undisclosed income without including
the same in the income declared, thereby
bringing down the effective rate of tax,
surcharge and penalty payable under the
Scheme to around 31 per cent?

It is clarified that the intent of the clarification issued
vide question No.5 of Circular No. 25 of 2016 was
limited to conduct of enquiry by the Department. It in
no way intends to modify or alter the rate of tax,
surcharge and penalty payable under the Scheme
which have been clearly specified in the Scheme itself.
Sections 184 & 185 of the Finance Act, 2016
unambiguously provide for payment of tax, surcharge
and penalty at the rate of 45 per cent of undisclosed
income.

7.

Whether there is any time limit for the
declarant under the Scheme to file Form-3?

As per section 187(2) of the Finance Act, 2016, the
time limit for filing Form-3 is same as the time limit
notified for payment of tax, surcharge and penalty under
the Scheme.

8.

Whether immunity from initiation of
prosecution would be available to the
Directors of the company or the partners
of the firm in respect of the undisclosed
income declared under the Scheme by the
company or partnership firm, as the case
may be?

Yes, immunity to the directors or the partners, as the
case may be, shall be available in respect of the
undisclosed income declared under the Scheme by the
company or partnership firm.

9.

Whether a person having undisclosed income Yes
in the form of an investment in immovable
property in the name of his spouse can
declare the fair market value of the property

determination of fair market value of quoted
shares and securities. In this context, it may
be clarified that if a share is listed on more
than one recognised stock exchange and
the quoted price of the share as on
01.06.2016 on the recognised stock
exchanges is different, then what shall be
the quoted share price for determining the
fair market value of such share under the

Questions

Answer

1.

In certain cases, the undisclosed income
might be reflected in creditors or other
liability which may be fictitious. Whether in
such cases, the assessee can disclose only
such fictitious liability as it may not be
possible to link it to any specific asset or
investment?

In a situation where loans, creditors, advances
received, share capital, payables etc. are disclosed in
the audited balance sheet but are fictitious in nature,
and such liabilities cannot be directly linked to
acquisition of a particular asset in the balance sheet,
then such fictitious liabilities can be disclosed under
the Scheme as such without linking the same with the
investment in any specific asset. However, in cases
where there is a direct link between the fictitious liability
and the asset acquired then the amount to be declared
shall be the fair market value of the acquired asset as
on 01.06.2016.

2.

Whether the amount declared under the
Scheme for an earlier assessment year can
be taken into account to explain the
transaction(s) in the assessment
proceedings for subsequent assessment
year(s)?

As per section 189 of the Finance Act, 2016, any
declaration made under the Scheme shall not affect
finality of completed assessments. However, in an
assessment proceeding before the Assessing Officer
for an assessment year subsequent to the year for
which the income is declared under the Scheme, the
income declared for an earlier assessment year can
be taken into account to explain the transactions
provided there is a nexus between the income declared
and the transactions of the subsequent assessment
year.

3.

Whether the valuation report of assets
declared under the Scheme shall be called
for by the department for any enquiry at any
time?

The valuation report from a registered valuer shall not
be questioned by the department. However, the valuer
is expected to furnish a true and correct valuation report
in accordance with the accepted principles of valuation.
In case of any misrepresentation, appropriate action
as per law shall be taken against the registered valuer.

4.

Though the fair market value as on 1st June,
2016 is taxed under IDS, and such amount

The issue was earlier considered and it was clarified
vide Circular No.17 dated 20.05.2016 that in such cases

Other Amendment vide Finance Act, 2016

689

will be treated as cost of acquisition at the
time of future sale of concerned asset,
whether such treatment shall affect the
character of the asset as long term or short
term?

period of holding shall be deemed to begin from
01.06.2016 as the asset has been revalued on such
date. However, considering the representation received
from various stakeholders and the fact that this may
lead to complications in calculation of capital gain at
the time of sale of asset which was partly funded from
undisclosed income now declared under the Scheme,
the matter has been reconsidered. Accordingly, in
supersession to the earlier clarification as referred
above, it is clarified that the period of holding of asset
declared under the Scheme shall be based on the
actual date of acquisition of such asset. However, the
indexation benefit in respect of the amount declared
under the Scheme shall be available from 01.06.2016
only.

5.

What will be the value of immovable property
to be declared under the Scheme in a case
where the cost of immovable property is
only partly evidenced by a registered deed
and partly otherwise?

In such a case, the option of calculating the fair market
value of the immovable property based on applying the
cost inflation index to stamp duty value shall be
available only in respect of that part of the property the
cost of which is evidenced by a registered deed. With
regard to the remaining part the fair market value of
the property shall be determined based on the
provisions of rule 3(1)(d) of the Rules without taking
into effect the proviso to the said rule.

6.

A declarant has already filed a declaration
under the Scheme determining the value of
immovable property on the basis of Income
Declaration Scheme Rules, 2016 prior to
their amendment vide the Income
Declaration Scheme (Third Amendment)
Rule notified vide CBDT Notification No. 74
dated 17.8.2016. In such a case whether
the declarant can revise the declaration
based on such amended rules?

Yes, the declarant can revise the fair market value of
immovable property declared in the declaration already
filed on account of the amended provisions of the
Income Declaration Scheme Rules, 2016 even in a
case where such revision may result in downward
revision of the declared amount in respect of the
immovable property.

7.

Whether the payment of amount payable
under the Scheme can be made in cash to
the Banks? Further, whether the amount
disclosed under the Scheme can be
deposited in the bank account in cash?

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been requested to
issue instructions to banks to allow payment of tax
under the Scheme in cash. RBI has also been
requested to instruct the banks to allow deposit of cash
over the counter in accordance with its existing master
circular No. DBOD No.Leg.BC.21/09.07.006/2014-15
dated 01.07.2014.

8.

Whether the information of cash deposits
made in bank as a consequent to
declaration made under the Scheme shall
be picked up by FIU or reported to the
income-tax department?

It is clarified that no adverse action shall be taken
against the declarant by FIU or the income-tax
department solely on the basis of the information
regarding cash deposit made consequent to the
declaration under the Scheme.

section 12A of the Income-tax Act files
declaration under the Scheme, whether the
registration under section 12A shall be
cancelled on the basis of such declaration?

information furnished in the declaration filed under the
Scheme.

deduction, say 175%, on account of
making bogus donation then what should be
the amount of declaration under the Scheme?

The declarant has to declare the amount of weighted
deduction claimed in respect of bogus donation i.e.
175% of the bogus donation in this case.

11.

In a case where the return of income has
not been filed for an assessment year but the
time limit for filing the same has not expired
under section 139 of the Income-tax Act,
whether the declaration under the Scheme
can be filed for such assessment year?

distribution tax shall be paid @ 25% if the distribution is made to an individual or a Hindu undivided family (HUF)
and @ 30% if the distribution is to others. Further, no distribution tax is to be levied if the distribution is made to
an exempt entity. Consequent to the levy of distribution tax, the income of the investor, received from the
securitisation trust, is exempt under section 10(35A) of the Act and the income of securitisation trust itself is
exempt under section 10(23DA) of the Act.
In order to rationalise the tax regime for securitisation trust and its investors, and to provide tax pass through
treatment, the provisions of the Act has been amended to substitute the existing special regime for securitisation
trusts by a new regime having the following elements:
i. The new regime shall apply to securitisation trust being an SPV defined under SEBI (Public Offer and
Listing of Securitised Debt Instrument) Regulations, 2008 or SPV as defined in the guidelines on
securitisation of standard assets issued by RBI or being setup by a securitisation company or a
reconstruction company in accordance with the SARFAESI Act;
ii. The income of securitisation trust shall continue to be exempt. However, exemption in respect of income
of investor from securitisation trust would not be available and any income from securitisation trust
would be taxable in the hands of investors;
iii. The income accrued or received from the securitisation trust shall be taxable in the hands of investor in
the same manner and to the same extent as it would have happened had investor made investment
directly in the underlying assets and not through the trust;
iv. Tax deduction at source shall be effected by the securitisation trust at the rate of 25% in case of payment
to resident investors which are individual or HUF and @ 30% in case of others. In case of payments to
non-resident investors, the deduction shall be at rates in force;
v. The facility for the investors to obtain low or nil deduction of tax certificate would be available; and
vi. The trust shall provide breakup regarding nature and proportion of its income to the investors and also
to the prescribed income-tax authority.
Further, it is provided that the current regime of distribution tax shall cease to apply in case of distribution made
by securitisation trusts with effect from 01.06.2016. These amendments will take effect from 1st June, 2016.

CLARIFICATION REGARDING THE DEFINITION OF THE TERM ‘UNLISTED SECURITIES’ FOR
THE PURPOSE OF SECTION 112 (1) (C)
Existing provisions of clause (c) of sub-section (1) of section 112 provide tax rate of ten per cent for long-term
capital gain arising from transfer of securities, whether listed or unlisted. The expression “securities” for the
purpose of the said provision has the same meaning as in clause (h) of section 2 of the Securities Contracts
(Regulations) Act, 1956 (32 of 1956)(‘SCRA’). A view has been taken by the courts that shares of a private
company are not “securities”.
With a view to clarify the position so far as taxability is concerned, clause (c) of sub-section (1) of section 112 of
the Income- tax Act has been amended to provide that long-term capital gains arising from the transfer of a
capital asset being shares of a company not being a company in which the public are substantially interested,
shall be chargeable to tax @ 10%.
These amendments effective from the 1st day of April, 2017 and accordingly apply in relation to assessment year
2017-18 and subsequent years.

CIRCULARS
Circular No. 1 of 2016 dated 15th February, 2016 (Clarification of the term ‘initial assessment year’ in
section 80IA(5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961)
The Board through this circular has clarified that it is abundantly clear from sub-section (2) that an assessee
who is eligible to claim deduction u/s 80IA has the options to choose the initial / first year from which it may
desire to claim the deduction for 10 consecutive year out of slab of 15 years or 20 years as prescribed under that
sub-section. It is hereby clarified that once such initial assessment year has been opted for by the assessee, he
shall be entitled to claim deduction u/s 80IA for ten consecutive years beginning from the year in respect of
which he has exercised such option subject to the fulfillment of conditions prescribed in the section. Hence the
term ‘initial assessment year’ would mean the first year opted for by the assessee for claiming deduction u/s
80IA of the Act. However, the total number of years for claiming deduction should not transgress the prescribed
slab of fifteen or twenty years as the case may be and the period of claim should be availed in continuity.
Circular No. 3 of 2016 dated 23 rd February, 2016 (Clarification regarding nature of share buy-back
transactions under Income Tax Act, 1961)
As per the provision of Section 46 of the Act applicable from 01.04.2000, any consideration received by the
shareholder or a holder of other specified securities from any company for purchase of its own share or other
specified security shall be, subject to the provision contained in section 48, deemed to be a capital gains.
Further sub-clause (iv) of clause (22) of section 2 of the Act excludes any payment made by the company on
purchase of its own share in accordance with the provision of section 77A of the companies Act from the ambit
of dividend. Further, the Finance Act 2013 subsequently introduced section 115QA w.e.f. 01.06.2013 as per
which any amount of distributed income by the company on buy-back of its unlisted share shall be charges to tax
and the company so distributing its income shall be liable to pay additional tax @ 20% of the distributed income.
The CBDT through this circular clarify that consideration received on buy-back of shares between the period
01.04.200 till 31.05.2013 would be taxed as capital gains in the hands of recipient in accordance with the
provision of section 46A of the Act and no such amount shall be treated as dividend in view of the provisions of
section 2(22)(iv).
Circular No. 4 of 2016 dated 29th February, 2016 (Tax Deduction at source on payments by broadcasters
or television channels to production houses for production of contents or programme for telecasting)
It has been clarified that where the content is produced as per the specification provided by the broadcaster /

Other Amendment vide Finance Act, 2016

695

telecaster and the copyright of the content and programme also gets transferred to the telecaster / broadcaster,
such contract is covered under the definition of ‘work’ in section 194C of the Act and therefore subject to TDS
provision.
However, in a case where the telecaster / broadcaster acquires only the telecasting / broadcasting rights of the
contents already produced by the production house, there is no contract for carrying out contract work as
required u/s 194C. Accordingly, such payment are not liable for TDS u/s 194C of the Act. However, the payment
of this nature may be laible for TDS deduction under other provision of the chapter XVII-C of the Act.
Circular No. 5 of 2016 dated 29th February, 2016
The issue is the applicability of TDS provisions on payments made by the television channels or media houses
publishing newspapers or magazines to advertising agencies for procuring and canvassing for advertisement
has been examined.
Further, another issue has been raised in various cases as to whether the fees / charges taken or retained by
the advertising companies from media companies for canvassing or booking advertisement (typically 15% of
the billing) is commission or discount.
It has been clarified that no TDS is attracted on payments made by the television channels / newspaper companies
to the advertising agency for booking or procuring of or canvassing for advertisements. It is also further clarified
that commission referred to in Question No. 27 of the Board’s circular no. 715 dated 8.8.95 does not refer to
payments by media companies to advertising companies for booking of advertisements but to payment for
engagement of models, artists, photographers, sportspersons etc. and therefore is not relevant to the issue of
TDS referred to in this circular.
Circular No. 6 of 2016 dated 29th February, 2016 (Issue of taxability of surplus on sale of shares and
securities - Capital Gains or Business Income - Instructions in order to reduce litigation)
Sub-section (14) of Section 2 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (‘Act’) defines the term “capital asset” to include
property of any kind held by an assessee, whether or not connected with his business or profession, but does
not include any stock-in-trade or personal assets subject to certain exceptions. As regards shares and other
securities, the same can be held either as capital assets or stock-in-trade/ trading assets or both. Determination
of the character of a particular investment in shares or other securities, whether the same is in the nature of a
capital asset or stock-in-trade, is essentially a fact-specific determination and has led to a lot ot uncertainty and
litigation in the past.
Over the years, the courts have laid down different parameters to distinguish the shares held as investments
from the shares held as stock-in-trade. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (‘CBDT) has also, through Instruction
No. 1827, dated August 31, 1989 and Circular No.4 of 2007 dated June 15, 2007, summarized the said principles
for guidance of the field formations.
Disputes, however, continue to exist on the application of these principles to the facts of an individual case since
the taxpayers find it difficult to prove the intention in acquiring such shares/securities. In this background, while
recognizing that no universal principal in absolute terms can be laid down to decide the character of income
from sale of shares and securities (i.e. whether the same is in the nature of capital gain or business income),
CBDT realizing that major part of shares/securities transactions takes place in respect of the listed ones and
with a view to reduce litigation and uncertainty in the matter, in partial modification to the aforesaid Circulars,
further instructs that the Assessing Officers in holding whether the surplus generated from sale of listed shares
or other securities would be treated as Capital Gain or Business Income, shall take into account the following:
a) Where the assessee itself, irrespective of the period of holding the listed shares and securities, opts to

696 EP-TL&P
treat them as stock-in-trade, the income arising from transfer of such shares/securities would be treated
as its business income,
b) In respect of listed shares and securities held for a period of more than 12 months immediately preceding
the date of its transfer, if the assessee desires to treat the income arising from the transfer thereof as
Capital Gain, the same shall not be put to dispute by the Assessing Officer. However, this stand, once
taken by the assessee in a particular Assessment Year, shall remain applicable in subsequent Assessment
Years also and the taxpayers shall not be allowed to adopt a different/contrary stand in this regard in
subsequent years;
c) In all other cases, the nature of transaction (i.e. whether the same is in the nature of capital gain or
business income) shall continue to be decided keeping in view the aforesaid Circulars issued by the
CBDT.
It is, however, clarified that the above shall not apply in respect of such transactions in shares/securities where
the genuineness of the transaction itself is questionable, such as bogus claims of Long Term Capital Gain /
Short Term Capital Loss or any other sham transactions.
It is reiterated that the above principles have been formulated with the sale objective of reducing litigation and
maintaining consistency in approach on the issue of treatment of income derived from transfer of shares and
securities. All the relevant provisions of the Act shall continue to apply on the transactions involving transfer of
shares and securities.
Circular No. 7 of 2016 dated 7th March, 2016 (Clarification regarding taxability of consortium members)
A consortium of contractors is often formed to implement large infrastructure project, particularly in Engineering,
Procurement and Construction (‘EPC’) contracts and Trunkey projects. The tax authorities in many cases have
taken a position that such a consortium constitutes an Association of Persons ‘AOP’ i.e separate entity for
charging tax. The claim of the taxpayer, on the other hand, is of a contrary view.
The Board has examined the matter and with a view to avoid tax disputes has decided that a consortium
arrangement for executing ‘EPC’ / Trunkey contracts which has the following attributes may not be treated as
AOP:
• Each member is independently responsible for executing its part of work through its own resources and
also bears the risk of its scope of work.
• Each member earn profits or incur losses based on the performance of the contract falling strictly within
its scope of work. However, consortium members may share contract price at gross level only to facilitate
convenience in billing.
• The men and material used for any area of work are under the risk and control of respective consortium
members.
• The control and management of the consortium is not unified and common management is only for the
inter-se coordination between the consortium members and administrative convenience.
There may be other additional factors also which may justify that the consortium is not an AOP and the same will
depend upon the specific facts and circumstances of a particular case, which need to be taken into consideration
while taking a view in the matter.
It is further clarified that this circular shall not applicable in cases where all or some of the members of the
consortium are associated enterprise within the meaning of section 92A of the Act. In such cases, the assessing
officer will decide whether an AOP is formed or not keeping in view the relevant provision of the Act and judicial

jurisprudence on this issue.
Circular No. 10/2016 dated 26th April, 2016
The Hon’ble High Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Worldwide Township Project Ltd.
considered the issue and observed that “it is well settled that a penalty under this provision is independent of the
assessment. The action inviting imposition of penalty is granting of loans above the prescribed limit otherwise
than through banking channels and as such infringement of section 269SS of the Act is not related to the income
that may be assessed or finally adjudicated. In this view Section 275(1)(a) of the Act would not be applicable and
the provisions of Section 275(1)(c) would be attracted.
The above judgment has been accepted by the CBDT and accordingly it is settled position that the period of
limitation of penalty proceedings u/s 271D and 271E of the Act is governed by the provisions of section 275(1)(c)
of the Act.
Circular No. 14/2016 dated 18th May, 2016
All the fields in Form No.60 shall be considered to be mandatory in respect of transactions entered on or after
1.04.2016. It is also decided that online reporting of declarations in Form No. 61 for quarter ending March, 2016
may be done along with report for quarter ending September, 2016.
Circular No. 15/2016 Dated 19th May, 2016
Whether or not an assessee engaged in printing and publishing is eligible for grant of additional depreciation
under clause (iia) of sub section (1) of section 32 of the Act, has been a contentious issue. In other words
whether printing or printing and publishing amounts to manufacture or production of article or thing has been
contented in legal forums.
The judgements of Hon’ble Delhi and kerala High courts on this issue has been accepted by the Board and now
it is therefore, a settled position that the business of printing or printing and publishing amounts to manufacture
or production of an article or thing and accordingly eligible for depreciation u/s 32(1)(iia) of the Act.
Circular No. 21/2016 Dated 27th May, 2016
It has been clarified vide circular no. 21/2016 that it shall not be mandatory to cancel the registration already
granted u/s 12AA to a charitable institution merely on the ground that the cut off specified in the proviso to
section 2(15) of the Act is exceeded in a particular year without there being any change in the nature of activities
of the institution. If in any particular year, the specified cut-off is exceeded, the tax exemption would be denied to
the institution in that year and cancellation of registration would not be mandatory unless such cancellation
becomes necessary on the grounds prescribed in the Act.
Clarification on applicability of Circular No. 21 of 2015
The monetary limit for filing an appeal before Income Tax Appellate Tribunal ‘ITAT’ and High Court were raised
to Rs. 10 lakhs and Rs. 20 lakhs respectively by circular no. 21 of 2015 dated 10.12.2015.
The CBDT further clarified that the above monetary limit would apply equally to cross objections under section
253(4) of the Act. Cross objection below this monetary limit already filed, should be perused for dismissal as
withdrawn / not passed. Filing of cross objections below the monetary limit may not be considered henceforth.
Similarly, reference to High Courts below the monetary limit of Rs. 20 lakhs should be perused for dismissal as
withdrawn / not passed. Reference below this limit may not be considered henceforth.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This part of the study covers the Service Tax and
Value Added Tax (VAT) including Central Sales
Tax (CST) and Goods and Service Tax. These
are the forms of indirect tax imposed on specified
services called "taxable services" and sale of
goods within the state and Inter-state called VAT
and CST respectively.
Service Tax was first brought into force with effect
from 1st July 1994. All service providers in India,
except those in the state of Jammu and Kashmir,
are required to pay a Service Tax in India. Initially
only three services were brought under the net of
service tax and the tax rate was 5%. Gradually
more services came under the ambit of Service
Tax and from 1st of July 2012 onwards service
tax is charged on all services excepts covered
under negative list of services or mega exemption
list of services.
VAT is a multi-stage tax levied at each stage of
the value addition chain, with a provision to allow
input tax credit (ITC) on tax paid at an earlier
stage, which can be appropriated against the
VAT liability on subsequent sale. With the
introduction VAT, state sales tax was replaced
with VAT however, CST is still in place which
will be phased out in coming times or as when
the GST will come into place.
To keep pace with all these changes, one has
to be very alert and updated. In order to comply
with the dynamic subject of tax laws, industry
requires the services of tax professionals like
Company Secretaries. And to keep pace with the
changes in law, one has to remain alert and
updated. After going through the lessons of
Service Tax and VAT, students will acquire
practical and procedural knowledge of Service
Tax, VAT and CST laws.

Background, Administration and Procedural Aspects of Service Tax

BACKGROUND
As the economy grows and develops, the contribution of the services sector becomes more substantial. Hence, tax
on services becomes substantial revenue for the Government. Although Service tax is a concept of the modern era
where developed economies as well as developing economies find over 70% of their gross economic output coming
from the service sector. Service tax was there in vogue even in the Mauryan period in India. Ms. Romila Thaper in
her work “Asoka and the Decline of the Mauryas”, at page 72 (London 196, paperback edition, 1997, by Oxford)
points out that services of weapon and implement makers were required to be provided to the state for a certain
number of days in a year. This was a form of service tax in that period. But in the modern context, because of the
increasing contribution of the service sector to the GDP of an economy, the importance of service tax is growing. As
under the WTO agreements governments are required to reduce customs tariffs, governments are considering
increase in service taxes revenues as a compensatory revenue generation mechanism. In terms of economics, tax
on services is an indirect tax. This is because the burden of service tax can be passed on to the customer i.e., the
recipient of the service. The service provider may also bear the burden of the tax by not passing or charging the
same to a customer.
Example: How the burden of service tax shifted on the consumer?
Mr. Mohit is practicing Company Secretary, he represent before the Tax Authorities on behalf of Mr. Neeraj and
raise a invoice of `1,00,000 plus service tax @ 15%.
Here, Mr. Neeraj is the client and he is required to pay the service tax of ` 15,000 in addition to the value of
services. Subsequently Mr. Mohit deposit the sum to treasury of Central Government.
The ultimate outcome of this is that the burden of service tax is on the consumer.
The Tax Reforms Committee headed by Dr. Raja J Chelliah recognized the revenue potential of the service
sector and recommended imposition of service tax on selected services (selective approach or positive list
approach). Consequently the service tax was imposed at a uniform rate of 5% in the Union Budget for 1994-95
on 3 services.
Finance Act, 2012 has made remarkable changes in service tax legislation whereby the concept of Positive list
of Taxable services has been replaced with a negative list. A negative list of services implies that there is, a list
of services which are not subject to service tax. Thus, Service tax is not chargeable on the services which are either
mentioned in the negative list or are exempted by issue of notification. This is in contrast to the earlier method of
taxation of services where the law had provided definition for each taxable service and all other undefined services
were outside the preview of Service Tax.
The taxation of services is completely overhauled from positive approach or selective services to negative list
approach. Now, no classification of services is required for the purpose of taxability. Moreover, only services rendered
in taxable territory are taxable for which Place of Provision of Service Rules, 2012 (‘PPSR’) are prescribed and with
this Import of Services and Export of Services Rules has been rescinded.

Reason for Imposition of Service Tax
In ALL INDIA FEDN. OF TAX PRACTITIONERS v. UNION OF INDIA 2007 (7) S.T.R. 625 (S.C.) the Hon’ble
Supreme Court of India has mentioned the following reasons for the imposition of service tax.
Service tax is an indirect tax levied on certain services provided by certain categories of persons including
companies, association, firms, body of individuals etc. Today services cover wide range of activities such as
management, banking, insurance, hospitality, consultancy, communication, administration, entertainment, research
and development activities forming part of retailing sector. Service sector is today occupying the centre stage of the
Indian economy. It has become an Industry by itself. In the contemporary world, development of service sector has

716 EP-TL&P
become synonymous with the advancement of the economy. Economists hold the view that there is no distinction
between the consumption of goods and consumption of services as both satisfy the human needs.
In late seventies, Government of India initiated an exercise to explore alternative revenue sources due to resource
constraints. The primary sources of revenue are direct and indirect taxes. Central excise duty is a tax on the goods
produced in India whereas customs duty is the tax on imports. The word “goods” has to be understood in
contradistinction to the word “services”. Customs and excise duty constitute two major sources of indirect taxes in
India. Both are consumption specific in the sense that they do not constitute a charge on the business but on the
client. However, by 1994, Government of India found revenue receipts from customs and excise on the decline due
to W.T.O. commitments and due to rationalization of duties on commodities. That list has increased since then.
Knowledge economy has made “services” an important revenue-earner.
After its introduction, the constitutional validity of the services taxed by the Central Government was challenged
before the Constitution Bench of this Court which took the view that the Central Government derived its authority
from Entry 97 of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution for levying tax on services provided.

CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY
As per Article 246 of the Constitution of India, law can be enacted by Parliament or the State legislature, if such
power is given by the Constitution of India.
Article 265 of the Constitution lays down that no tax shall be levied or collected except by the authority of law.
Schedule VII divides there subjects into three categories –
(a) Union list (only Central Government has power of legislation)
(b) State list (only State Government has power of legislation)
(c) Concurrent list (both Central and State Government can pass legislation).
Entry 97 of the Union list is the residuary entry and empowers the Central Government to levy tax on any matter not
enumerated in state list or the concurrent list.
In 1994, the service tax was levied by the Central Government under the power granted by the entry 97 of the union
list. Thereafter, in 2003 the government has passed the constitution (88th Amendment Act, 2003) which provides for
the levy of service tax by the centre through the insertion of article 268A to the constitution. In addition to article
268A, entry 92C has also been inserted in the union list to make the enactment relating to service tax a subject
matter of union list. However, since entry No.92C has not yet been made effective by the Parliament and Service
Tax is still governed by the entry 97 of the union list.

ADMINISTRATIVE MECHANISM
Service tax is administered by the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) which is under the control of the
Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance. CBEC administers the service tax through the Central Excise Department.
Central Excise Commissionrate has established a separate cell called the Service Tax Cell for the purpose of administration
of service tax within its jurisdiction. Considering large number of assessees, CBEC has also established Service Tax
Commissionerates in some major cities which deal exclusively with work related to Service Tax. These Commissionerates
are supervised by the jurisdictional Chief Commissionerate of Central Excise.

for the common use of its members.
(ii) If the contribution of a member/s of a RWA exceeds five thousand rupees per month, how should the
service tax liability be calculated?
If per month per member contribution of any or some members of a RWA exceeds five thousand rupees,
the entire contribution of such members whose per month contribution exceeds five thousand rupees
would be ineligible for the exemption under the said notification. Service tax would then be leviable on the
aggregate amount of monthly contribution of such members
(iii) Is threshold exemption under notification No. 33/2012-ST available to RWA?
Threshold exemption available under notification No. 33/2012-ST is applicable to a RWA, subject to conditions

name of its members, acting as a ‘pure agent’ of its members, is exclusion from value of taxable service
available for the purposes of exemptions provided in Notification 33/2012-ST or 25/2012-ST ?
In Rule 5(2) of the Service Tax (Determination of Value) Rules, 2006, it is provided that expenditure or costs
incurred by a service provider as a pure agent of the recipient of service shall be excluded from the value of
taxable service, subject to the conditions specified in the Rule.
For illustration, where the payment for an electricity bill raised by an electricity transmission or distribution
utility in the name of the owner of an apartment in respect of electricity consumed thereon, is collected and
paid by the RWA to the utility, without charging any commission or a consideration by any other name, the
RWA is acting as a pure agent and hence exclusion from the value of taxable service would be available.
However, in the case of electricity bills issued in the name of RWA, in respect of electricity consumed for
common use of lifts, motor pumps for water supply, lights in common area, etc., since there is no agent
involved in these transactions, the exclusion from the value of taxable service would not be available.
(v) Is CENVAT credit available to RWA for payment of service tax?
RWA may avail cenvat credit and use the same for payment of service tax, in accordance with the Cenvat
Credit Rules.
“trade union” has the meaning assigned to it in clause (h) of section 2 of the Trade Unions Act, 1926 (16 of 1926).

For clarification Taxation of services – An Education Guide dated 20.06.2012, provides the following:
2.8.12 Would recharge vouchers issued by service companies for enabling clients/consumers to avail services
like mobile phone communication, satellite TV broadcasts, DTH broadcasts etc be ‘actionable claims?
No. Such recharge vouchers do not create a ‘beneficial interest’ in a moveable property but only enable a person to
enjoy a particular service.
7.11.11 Whether the exemption provided in the mega -exemption to services by way of construction of roads,
airports, railways, transport terminals, bridges, tunnels, dams etc., is also available to the sub-contractors who
provide input service to these main contractors in relation to such construction?
As per clause (1) of section 66F reference to a service by nature or description in the Act will not include reference
to a service used for providing such service. Therefore, if any person is providing services, in respect of projects
involving construction of roads, airports, railways, transport terminals, bridges, tunnels, dams etc., such as architect
service, consulting engineer service which are used by the contractor in relation to such construction, the benefit
of the specified entries in the mega-exemption would not be available to such persons unless the activities carried
out by the sub-contractor independently and by itself falls in the ambit of the exemption.
It has to be appreciated that the wordings used in the exemption are ‘services by way of construction of roads etc’
and not ‘services in relation to construction of roads etc’. It is thus apparent that just because the main contractor
is providing the service by way of construction of roads, airports, railways, transport terminals, bridges, tunnels,
dams etc., it would not automatically lead to the classification of services being provided by the sub-contractor to
the contractor as an exempt service.
However, a sub-contractor providing services by way of works contract to the main contractor, providing exempt
works contract services, has been exempted from service tax under the mega exemption if the main contractor is
engaged in providing exempt services of works contracts. It may be noted that the exemption is available to subcontractors engaged in works contracts and not to other outsourced services such as architect or consultants.

not cover mere or predominant transfer of an activity comprising a service. Such sale of business as a whole will
comprise comprehensive sale of immovable property, goods and transfer of unexecuted orders, employees, goodwill

“Notwithstanding anything contained in section 66 as it stood prior to the 1st day of July, 2012, no service tax

set up under the Employees’ State Insurance Act, 1948, during the period prior to the 1st day of July, 2012.”

EXEMPTION TO SMALL SERVICE PROVIDERS:
It is not advisable to collect tax from small service providers. Also that it is administratively not feasible to collect
from small service providers. Hence government has decided to exempt small service providers on the basis of their
turnover. However this is an optional scheme and the small service provider may adopt normal scheme without
availing the exemption. Moreover, eligibility is on yearly basis. This exemption is available on the basis of conditions
to be fulfilled. Notification No.33/ 2012, provides exemption to small service providers.
Exemption limit Rs. 10 lakh as per the bills raised/ required to be raised in the current year towards value of the
services (excluding the value of exempted services).
Eligibility : the aggregate value of services provided excluding the value of exempted services in previous year
shall not exceed Rs. 10 lakh.

The exemption does not apply in two cases:
1. If service is provided under a brand name- A service provided under a brand name or trade name of
others, whether registered or not, is not eligible to exemption. Brand name or, trade name can be a mark,
symbol, logo, monogram, label, etc.
2. If the receiver of service tax is liable to pay the service tax- In certain cases the receiver of service is
liable to pay the service tax and not the provider of service. The receiver is not eligible to exemption for
such service. This is also known as reverse charge.

PLACE OF PROVISION OF SERVICES RULES
Service Tax Is Destination Based Consumption Tax
Service Tax is a Value Added Tax (VAT) and is destination based consumption tax in the sense that it is levied on
commercial activities and is not a charge on the business but on the consumer and it would, logically, be leviable
only on services provided within the country. This principle is more or less universally applied. In terms of this
principle, exports are not charged to tax, as the consumption is outside the taxable territory, however, services are
taxed on their importation into the taxable territory.
Since, most of the services are intangible in nature; the determination of place of their consumption is not easy.
Services could be provided by a person located at one location, actually performed at another while being
delivered to a person located at a third location, and occasionally actually consumed at a third location or over a
larger geographical territory, falling in more than one taxable jurisdiction. For example a person situated in Delhi
may buy a ticket on line from a service provider located outside India, say Delta Airline, USA for a journey from
Mumbai to New York, wherein part of the service will be provided on Indian land, (taxable territory, the territory of
India including territorial waters of India extending up to 12 nautical miles. Hence, services provided beyond the
territorial waters of India are not liable to service tax as the provisions of the service tax do not extend beyond
India. On other occasions the exact location of service recipient itself may not be available e.g. services supplied
electronically through internet such as software services, web based services, software maintenance services.
As a result, it is necessary to lay down rules determining the exact place of provision, while ensuring a certain
level of harmonization with international practices so as to avoid both the double taxation as well as double nontaxation of services.
In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of section 66C and clause (hhh) of sub-section (2) of
section 94 of the Finance Act, 1994, the Central Government has issued Place of Provision of services Rules,
2012 vide Notification No. 28/2012-ST dated 20-06-2012 for the purpose of determination of the place of provision
of services.

Function of Place of Provision of Services Rules, 2012
These rules are primarily meant for:
(a) The assessee who deal in cross-border services (from taxable territory to non taxable territory or from non
taxable territory to taxable territory).
(b) Those assessees who have operations with suppliers or customers in the state of Jammu and
Kashmir.
(c) Service providers operating within India (within the taxable territory) from multiple locations, without having
centralized registration will find them useful in determining the precise taxable jurisdiction applicable to
their operations.
(d) Determining services that are wholly consumed within a SEZ, to avail the outright exemption from service tax.

744 EP-TL&P

Basic Framework
Place of Provision of Services (POPS) Rules, 2012 are comprehensive set of rules which provides for whether a
service has been provided in taxable territory or not. The concept of Export or Import service has been replaced with
provision of service in taxable or non taxable territory and therefore no separate set of rules for Export and Import of
services exists. The rules for determination of import of services has done away with and export of services are now
determined with Rule 6A of Service Tax Rules, 1994.

How the POPS Rules, 2012 shall apply
The answer to this question is provided in Para 5.2.1. of Taxation of Services – An Education Guide dated
20.06.2012 as follows:
As stated earlier, in terms of section 66B, a service is taxable only when, inter alia, it is “provided (or agreed to be
provided) in the taxable territory”. Thus, the taxability of a service will be determined based on the place of its
provision. For determining the taxability of a service, therefore, one needs to ask the following questions sequentially:1. Which rule applies to the service provided specifically? In case more than one rules apply equally, which of
these come later in the order given in the rules?
2. What is the place of provision of the service in terms of the above rule?
3. Is the place of provision in taxable territory? If yes, tax will be payable. If not, tax will not be payable.
4. Is the provider ‘located’ in the taxable territory? If yes, he will pay the tax.
5. If not, is the service receiver located in taxable territory? If yes, he may be liable to pay tax on reverse
charge basis.
6. Is the service receiver an individual or government receiving services for a non business purpose, or a
charity receiving services for a charitable activity? If yes, the same is exempted. If not, he is liable to pay
tax.
Before moving to the Rules for determining the Place of provision of Services Rules, the understanding of the
following term is very important.
Taxable territory has been defined in sub-section 52 of section 65B. It means the territory to which the provisions
of Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1994 apply i.e. whole of India excluding the state of Jammu and Kashmir.
“Non-taxable territory” is defined in sub-section 35 ibid accordingly as the territory other than the taxable
territory.
“India” is defined in sub-section 27 of section 65 B, as follows:
“India” means –
(a) the territory of the Union of India as referred to in clauses (2) and (3) of article 1 of the Constitution;
(b) its territorial waters, continental shelf, exclusive economic zone or any other maritime zone as defined in
the Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone and Other Maritime Zones Act, 1976;
(c) the sea-bed and the subsoil underlying the territorial waters;
(d) the air space above its territory and territorial waters; and
(e) the installations structures and vessels located in the continental shelf of India and the exclusive economic
zone of India, for the purposes of prospecting or extraction or production of mineral oil and natural gas and
supply thereof;

Order of Application of POPS, Rules 2012
Rule 14 of POPS rules, provides that rules should be interpreted in reverse order, means rules which comes last in
order will be considered first and if that is not applicable then go to the second last and so on. These rules should
be applied in the reverse order (from below to above) i.e. in case rule 8 is applicable no other rule prior to this rule
shall be applicable.
An illustration is given in Para 5.14.1 of Taxation of Services – An Education Guide dated 20.06.2012 as follows:
Illustration
An architect based in Mumbai provides his service to an Indian Hotel Chain (which has business establishment
in New Delhi) for its newly acquired property in Dubai. If Rule 5 (Property rule) were to be applied, the place of
provision would be the location of the property i.e. Dubai (outside the taxable territory). With this result, the
service would not be taxable in India. Whereas, by application of Rule 8, since both the provider and the receiver
are located in taxable territory, the place of provision would be the location of the service receiver i.e. New Delhi.
Place of provision being in the taxable territory, the service would be taxable in India.
By application of Rule 14, the later of the Rules i.e. Rule 8 would be applied to determine the place of provision.

Main Rule: Rule 3
Rule 3 of the POPS rules provide the basic rule (except provided otherwise in the POPS Rules 4 to 12). As per this
rule, the place of provision of services shall be:
– the location of the recipient of service
– in case the location of the service receiver is not available in the ordinary course of business, the place of
provision shall be the location of the provider of service.
The Principal effect of this rule is that:
A. If the location of service receiver is not available, location of service provider is the place of provision of
service;
B. If the service receiver is located outside taxable territory, however service provider is located in the taxable
territory, then the service will deemed to be provided in the taxable territory and service tax will be payable.
Under normal circumstances, a service provider is liable to pay service tax. However, if he is located outside the
taxable territory and the place of provision of service is in the taxable territory, the person liable to pay service tax
is service receiver in the taxable territory.
Rule 2 defines ‘location of service provider’ as follows:
(h) “location of the service provider” means(a) where the service provider has obtained a single registration, whether centralized or otherwise, the
premises for which such registration has been obtained;
(b) where the service provider is not covered under sub-clause (a):
(i) the location of his business establishment; or
(ii) where the services are provided from a place other than the business establishment, that is to say,
a fixed establishment elsewhere, the location of such establishment; or
(iii) where services are provided from more than one establishment, whether business or
(iv) fixed, the establishment most directly concerned with the provision of the service; and in the
absence of such places, the usual place of residence of the service provider.

746 EP-TL&P
Rule 2 defines ‘location of service receiver’ as follows

(iii) where services are used at more than one establishment, whether business or fixed, the
establishment most directly concerned with the use of the service; and
(iv) in the absence of such places, the usual place of residence of the recipient of service.
Explanation:-. For the purposes of clauses (h) and (i), “usual place of residence” in case of a body corporate
means the place where it is incorporated or otherwise legally constituted.
Explanation 2:-. For the purpose of clause (i), in the case of telecommunication service, the usual place of
residence shall be the billing address.

Who is a service receiver?
Para 5.3.3 of Taxation of Services – An Education Guide dated 20.06.2012 provides as follows:
Normally, the person who is legally entitled to receive a service and, therefore, obliged to make payment for
services, is the receiver of a service, whether or not he actually makes the payment or someone else makes the
payment on his behalf.
Service tax is normally required to be paid by the provider of a service, except where he is located outside the
taxable territory and the place of provision of service is in the taxable territory.
Where the provider of a service is located outside the taxable territory, the person liable to pay service tax is the
receiver of the service in the taxable territory, unless of course, the service is otherwise exempted.
Following illustration will make this clear:Taxable Territory

Non-axable Territory

ABC

DEF

Service Provider

Receiver





PQR

XYX

Receiver

Service Provider

A company ABC provides a service to a receiver PQR, both located in the taxable territory. Since the location of
the receiver is in the taxable territory, the service is taxable. Service tax liability will be discharged by ABC, being
the service provider and being located in taxable territory.

748 EP-TL&P
However, if ABC were to supply the same service to a recipient DEF located in non-taxable territory, the provision of
such service is not taxable, since the receiver is located outside the taxable territory.
If the same service were to be provided to PQR (located in taxable territory) by an overseas provider XYZ (located in
non-taxable territory), the service would be taxable, since the recipient is located in the taxable territory. However,
since the service provider is located in a non-taxable territory, the tax liability would be discharged by the receiver,
under the reverse charge principle (also referred to as “tax shift”).

INTERPRETATION OF SERVICES AND BUNDLED SERVICES UNDER SECTION 66F
S66 F(1): Unless otherwise specified, reference to a service (herein referred to as main service) shall not include
reference to a service which is used for providing main service.
Eg. Main service may be in the negative list. But the service provided to such negative list services cannot be
treated as exempt. Toll tax service is not taxable but security agency providing service to such toll tax service
provider is still taxable.
S66 F(2): where a service is capable of differential treatment for any purpose based on its description, the most
specific description shall be preferred over a more general description.
S66 F(3): Subject to provisions of subsection (2), the taxability of a bundled service shall be determined in the
following manner, namely:(a) if various elements of such service are naturally bundled in the ordinary course of business, it shall be
treated as provision of the single service which gives such bundle its essential character;
(b) if various elements of such service are not naturally bundled in the ordinary course of business, it shall be
treated as provision of the single service which results in highest liability of service tax.
Explanation: For the purposes of subsection (3), the expression bundled service means a bundle of provision of
various services wherein an element of provision of one service is combined with an element or elements of provision
of any other service or services.

EXPORT OF SERVICES
Export of Services, Rule 6A of Service Tax Rules, 1994
(1) The provision of any service provided or agreed to be provided shall be treated as export of service when(a) The provider of service is located in the taxable territory,
(b) The recipient of the service is located outside India,
(c) The service is not a service specified in the section 66D of the Act,
(d) The place of provision of the service is outside India,
(e) The payment for such services has been received by the provider of service in convertible foreign
exchange, and
(f) The provider of service and recipient of service are not merely establishments of a distinct person in
accordance with item (b) of Explanation 3 of clause (44) of section 65B of the Act.
(2) Where any service is exported, the Central Government may, by notification, grant rebate of service tax or
duty paid on input services or inputs, as the case may be, used in providing such service and the rebate
shall be allowed subject to such safeguards, conditions and limitations, as may be specified, by the
Central Government, by notification.

749

REBATE OF SERVICE TAX ON SERVICES EXPORTED TO ANY COUNTRY OTHER THAN
NEPAL & BHUTAN NOTIFICATION NO.39/ 2012 DT. 20-06-2012
Conditions and Limitations:(a) that the taxable service has been exported in terms of Rule 6A of the Service Tax Rules ,1994 and
payment for export of such taxable service has been received in India in convertible foreign exchange.
(b) that excise duty on inputs and the service tax and cess, rebate of which has been claimed, have been paid
on the taxable services exported
(c) the amount of rebate of service tax and cess admissible is Rs. 1000/-or more
(d) no cenvat credit has been claimed on inputs and input services on which rebate is claimed.

RATE OF SERVICE TAX
The rate of service tax is mentioned in the charging section i.e. section 66B of Finance Act, 1994. After the
amendments made vide Finance Act, 2015 made effective, service tax is leviable @ 14% w.e.f. 01.06.2015.

At what rate the service tax is to be calculated?
• The prescribe rate of service tax is 14% w.e.f. 1-6-2015.
• Swachh Bharat Cess is 0.5 % w.e.f. 15-11-2015. So the effective service tax rate w.e.f. 15-11-2015 was
14.5 % including swachh bharat cess.
Further, the effective rate of service tax has been increased from 14.5 % to 15% (on the account of levy of Krishi
Kalyan Cess @ 0.5% w.e.f. 1st June, 2016). So the effective service tax rate w.e.f. 01-06-2016 is 15 % including
Swachh Bharat Cess and Krishi Kalyan Cess.

ROUNDING OFF OF SERVICE TAX
The provisions of Section 37D of the Central Excise Act, 1944 are applicable to Service Tax Law by virtue of Section
83 of Finance Act, 1994 (as amended), provide that the amount of service tax, interest, penalty, fine or any other sum
payable and the amount of refund or any other sum due, under the provisions shall be rounded off to the nearest rupee
and, for this purpose, where such amount contains a part of a rupee consisting of paise then, if such part is fifty paise
or more, it shall be increased to one rupee and if such part is less than fifty paise it shall be ignored.

LESSON ROUND UP
– The Tax Reform Committee headed by Dr. Raja C. Chelliah recognised the revenue potential of service
sector and recommended imposition of service tax on some select services.
– Entry No. 92C has not yet been made effective by the parliament and service tax is still governed by
the entry 97 of the union list.
– The Central Board of Excise and Customs has been entrusted with the task of administration of service
tax.
– The taxation of services is completely overhauled from positive approach or selective services to negative
list approach. Now, no classification of services is required for the purpose of taxability.
– With the introduction of Negative list approach the services which are out of the purview of negative list
and mega exemption list are chargeable to service tax.
– Services rendered in taxable territory are taxable for which Place of Provision of Service Rules, 2012

750 EP-TL&P
(‘POPSR’) are prescribed and with this Import of services and export of services rules has been rescinded.
– Service tax is charged @ 15% (inclusive of Swach Bharat Cess & Krishi Kalyan Cess).
– Service tax, interest, fine, penalty or any other sum payable shall be rounded off to the nearest of rupee one.

INTRODUCTION
As explained in previous lesson, Service Tax is a tax levied by Central Government on services provided or to be
provided for consideration, excluding the services covered under negative list and exemption notification after
considering the provisions prescribed under the ‘Place of Provision of Services Rules, 2012’.
Now let us understand from whom, how and when is it collected.

PAYMENT OF SRVICE TAX
As per sub section (1) of section 68 of the Finance Act, 1994, every person providing taxable service to any person
shall pay service tax at the rate specified in section 66 in such manner and within such period as may be prescribed.
Further, subsection (2) of the section 68, provides that notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), in
respect of such taxable service as may be notified by the Central Government in the Official Gazette, the service
tax thereon shall be paid by such person and in such manner as may be prescribed at the rate specified in section
66 and all the provisions of this chapter shall apply to such person as if he is the person liable for paying the service
tax in relation to such service.
Provided that the Central Government may notify the service and the extent of service tax which shall be payable by
such person and the provisions of this Chapter shall apply to such person to the extent so specified and the
remaining part of the service tax shall be paid by the service provider.
Thus, person liable to pay service tax may be service provider or service receiver or any other person made so liable.
Notification No. 30/2012 dated 20.06.2012 provided for the services where service tax shall be paid by the service
receiver. However, as per Notification No. 7/2015 dated 01.03.2015, the provisions have been amended and with
effect from 01-03.2015, these provisions are applicable not only to service provider and receiver but to any other
person liable for paying service tax for the taxable services specified in paragraph I (of the Notification No. 30/2012
as amended from time to time)
The extent of service tax payable thereon by the person who provides the service and any other person liable for
paying service tax for the taxable services specified in paragraph I shall be as specified in the following Table,

– Change of rate of service tax
– Imposition of service tax on new services
– Continuous supply of services
Moreover, POT rules, 2011 have been introduced to bring synchronization between service tax and other taxes like
Excise Duty and VAT which work on accrual basis and this is a step towards implementation of GST.
POT rules, 2011 were issued by the Central Government vide Notification No. 18/2011- ST dated 1st March, 2011
w.e.f. 1st April 2011. However, these rules were made effective w.e.f. 1st July 2011 vide Notification No.25/2011-ST
dated 31st March 2011. Now, let us discuss the provisions of these rules:
Point of taxation means the point in time when a service shall be provided or deemed to have been provided. This
Point of time will determine rate of service tax and due date of payment of service tax.
As per rule 2A of POT Rules, “Date of payment” shall be the earlier of the dates on which the payment is entered in
the books of accounts or is credited to the bank account of the person liable to pay tax:
Provided that –
(A) the date of payment shall be the date of credit in the bank account when –
(i) there is a change in effective rate of tax or when a service is taxed for the first time during the period
between such entry in books of accounts and its credit in the bank account; and
(ii) the credit in the bank account is after four working days from the date when there is change in effective
rate of tax or a service is taxed for the first time; and
(iii) the payment is made by way of an instrument which is credited to a bank account,
(B) if any rule requires determination of the time or date of payment received, the expression “date of payment”
shall be construed to mean such date on which the payment is received”.
As per Rule 3 of Point of Taxation Rules, Point of taxation shall be;
(a) the time when the invoice for service provided or to be provided is issued or
(b) in case where payment is received before the issue of invoice then the time when such payment is received or
(c) where advance is received by the service provider the time of receipt of such advance.
Rule 4A of the Service Tax Rules, 1994, provides that every person providing taxable service shall issue invoice
within 30 days of completion of service or receipt of payment of service whichever is earlier.
Further proviso to Rule 3 of POT Rules, provides that where the invoice is not issued within 30 days of completion
of service then the point of taxation shall be the date of completion of such service.

Continuous Supply of Service
“Continuous supply of service” means any service provided or agreed to be provided continuously or on recurrent
basis, under a contract, for a period exceeding three months with the obligation for payment periodically or from
time to time. Further, Central Government may notify provision of a particular service to be considered as continuous

As per Rule 3, in case of continuous supply of service, the point of taxation shall be the date of completion of the
events as specified in the contract or time when invoice for the service provided or to be provided is issued or the
date on which payment is received whichever is earlier. Where any advance is received by the service provider the

days of completion of such event then point of taxation shall be the date of completion of such event.

Point of Taxation in case of change in effective rate of tax (Rule 4)
Notwithstanding anything contained in Rule 3, the point of taxation in cases where there is a change in effective rate
of tax in respect of a service, shall be determined in the following manner, namely:(a) in case a taxable service has been provided before the change in effective rate of tax,(i) where the invoice for the same has been issued and the payment received after the change in effective
rate of tax, the point of taxation shall be date of payment or issuing of invoice, whichever is earlier; or
(ii) where the invoice has also been issued prior to change in effective rate of tax but the payment is
received after the change in effective rate of tax, the point of taxation shall be the date of issuing of
invoice; or
(iii) where the payment is also received before the change in effective rate of tax, but the invoice for the
same has been issued after the change in effective rate of tax, the point of taxation shall be the date of
payment;
(b) in case a taxable service has been provided after the change in effective rate of tax,(i) where the payment for the invoice is also made after the change in effective rate of tax but the invoice
has been issued prior to the change in effective rate of tax, the point of taxation shall be the date of
payment; or
(ii) where the invoice has been issued and the payment for the invoice received before the change in
effective rate of tax, the point of taxation shall be the date of receipt of payment or date of issuance of
invoice, whichever is earlier; or
(iii) where the invoice has also been raised after the change in effective rate of tax but the payment has been
received before the change in effective rate of tax , the point of taxation shall be date of issuing of invoice.

(a) no tax shall be payable to the extent the invoice has been issued and the payment received against such
invoice before such service became taxable;

762 EP-TL&P

The point of taxation in respect of the persons required to pay tax as recipients of service under the rules made in
this regard in respect of services notified under sub-section (2) of section 68 of the Act, shall be the date on which
payment is made.
Provided that, where the payment is not made within a period of three months of the date of invoice, the point of
taxation shall be the date immediately following the said period of three months.
Further, if the invoice in respect of a service, for which point of taxation is determinable under rule 7 has been issued
before the 1st day of October, 2014 but payment has not been made as on the said day, the point of taxation shall,–
(a) if payment is made within a period of six months of the date of invoice, be the date on which payment is made;
(b) if payment is not made within a period of six months of the date of invoice, be determined as if rule 7 and

amount of the consideration for the provision of service is not ascertainable at the time when service was
performed, and subsequently the use or the benefit of these services by a person other than the provider gives
rise to any payment of consideration, the service shall be treated as having been provided each time;
– when a payment in respect of such use or the benefit is received by the provider in respect thereof, or
– an invoice is issued by the provider, whichever is earlier.

Determination of Point of Taxation based on best judgement (Rule 8A)
Where the point of taxation cannot be determined as per these rules as the date of invoice or the date of
payment or both are not available, the Central Excise officer, may, require the concerned person to produce
such accounts, documents or other evidence as he may deem necessary and after taking into account such
material and the effective rate of tax prevalent at different points of time, shall, by an order in writing, after giving an
opportunity of being heard, determine the point of taxation to the best of his judgment.

ADJUSTMENT OF SERVICE TAX
(1) Adjustment of excess service tax paid on the services which are not so provided
Where an assessee has issued an invoice, or received any payment, against a service to be provided which is not
so provided by him either wholly or partially for any reason, or where the amount of invoice is renegotiated due to
deficient provision of service, or any terms contained in a contract the assessee may take the credit of such excess
service tax paid by him, if the assessee,
(a) has refunded the payment or part thereof, so received along with the service tax payable thereon for the
service to be provided by him to the person from whom it was received;
(b) has issued a credit note for the value of the service tax not so provided to the person to whom such an
invoice had been issued.

(2) Adjustment of excess service tax paid in other cases
Where an assessee has paid to the credit of Central Government any amount in excess of the amount required to
be paid towards service tax liability for a month or quarter, the assessee may adjust such excess amount paid by
him against his service tax liability for the succeeding month or quarter.
The adjustment of excess amount paid, shall be subject to the conditions that the excess amount is paid on account
of reasons not involving interpretation of law, taxability, valuation or applicability of any exemption notification.

VALUATION OF TAXABLE SERVICES
Section 67 provides for the method of valuation of taxable services i.e. the value on which service provider is required
to discharge service tax. As per section 67, the valuation of taxable service shall be determined under the following
two situations:

Lesson 17

Levy, Collection and Payment of Service Tax

765

– Service tax is separately charged in the bill
– Bill value is inclusive of service tax
Where the service tax is separately charged in the bill:
(i) in a case where the provision of service is for a consideration in money, be the gross amount charged by
the service provider for such service provided or to be provided by him;
(ii) in a case where the provision of service is for a consideration not wholly or partly consisting of money, be
such amount in money, with the addition of service tax charged, is equivalent to the consideration;
(iii) in a case where the provision of service is for a consideration which is not ascertainable, be the amount as
may be determined in the prescribed manner.
Where the bill is inclusive of service tax:
Where the gross amount charged by a service provider, for the service provided or to be provided is inclusive of
service tax payable, the value of such taxable service shall be such amount as, with the addition of tax payable, is
equal to the gross amount charged. In this case, value of taxable services shall be calculated as follows:

Gross Amount  100
Value of taxable Services = 100  Applicable rate of service tax
‘As per section 67 of the Finance Act, 1994
“consideration” includes –
(i) any amount that is payable for the taxable services provided or to be provided;
(ii) any reimbursable expenditure or cost incurred by the service provider and charged, in the course of providing
or agreeing to provide a taxable service, except in such circumstances, and subject to such conditions, as
may be prescribed;
(iii) any amount retained by the lottery distributor or selling agent from gross sale amount of lottery ticket in
addition to the fee or commission, if any, or, as the case may be, the discount received, that is to say, the
difference in the face value of lottery ticket and the price at which the distributor or selling agent gets such
ticket.’.
Example:
Pawan rendered a taxable service to a client on 25-08-2016. A bill of ` 40,000 was raised on 29-08-2016; ` 15,000
was received from the client on 1-10-2016 and the balance on 23-10-2016.
(a) If service tax was separately charged in the bill, what is the value of taxable services and service tax
payable?
(b) No Service tax was separately charged in the
– Is Pawan liable to pay service tax, even though the same has not been charged by him?
– In case, he is liable, what is the value of taxable services and service tax payable?
Solution
The bill is raised on 29-08-2016 but the payment is received in October 2016. As per Point of Taxation
Rules, service tax shall be payable on or before 05-09-2016 or 06-09-2016 and not in October when payment is
received.
Therefore, in this case service tax shall be payable as;
(a) Value of taxable service is ` 40,000, therefore service tax shall be payable @15%

766 EP-TL&P
Service tax = `40,000 x 15% = ` 6000/(b) Pawan is liable to pay service tax even though the tax has not been collected by him. The service tax
payable shall be;
= 40,000 x 15/115 = ` 5217/Note : SBC and KKC have been ignored in the above example

ABATEMENT IN SERVICE TAX
Abatement in Service Tax is a major relief to certain kinds of services which are chargeable to service tax. Finance
Act 1994 provides that for determining value of service tax on which service tax is to be charged abatement in value
determination is allowed.
Abatement under service tax laws means that for certain services, a specified percentage of discount is allowed
from the gross amount collected for rendering the services subject to the conditions that CENVAT Credit has not
been availed by the service provider.
Notification No. 26/2012- ST dated 20/06/2012 provides the list of services on which abatement is allowed. It also
provides for the percentage on which service tax is payable under the scheme of abatement. The concept of
abatement may be understood with the help of this example;
As per notification No. 26/2012, railway required to charge service tax only on 30% value of the Taxable services.
Thereby by virtue of this provision, if railways receive an amount of ` 50 Lakhs against the services, it needs to pay
service tax only on ` 15 Lakhs i.e. 30% value of ` 50 Lakhs. The abatments are subjects to conditions.
Note : Table containing abatement rates has been given in this lesson.

RECORDS TO BE MAINTAINED
Every assessee shall furnish to the Superintendent of Central Excise at the time of filing of return for the first time
or the 31st day of January, 2008, whichever is later, a list in duplicate of(i) all the records prepared or maintained by the assessee for accounting of transactions in regard to,(a) providing of any service,
(b) receipt or procurement of input services and payment for such input services;
(c) receipt, purchase, manufacture, storage, sale, or delivery, as the case may be, in regard of inputs and
capital goods;
(d) other activities, such as manufacture and sale of goods, if any.
(ii) all other financial records maintained by him in the normal course of business;
All such records shall be preserved at least for a period of five years immediately after the financial year to which
such records pertain.
The records including computerised data, as maintained by an assessee in accordance with the various laws in
force from time to time shall be acceptable.

RETURNS UNDER SERVICE TAX
Rule 7 of the Service Tax Rules, 1994 return under Service Tax is required to be filed by every assessee on half
yearly basis in Form ST-3 or Form ST-3A, as the case may be, along with a copy of the Form TR-6/GAR-7, in
triplicate for the months covered in the half-yearly return.

Lesson 17

Levy, Collection and Payment of Service Tax

767

Every assessee shall submit the half yearly return by the 25th of the month following the particular half-year. Every
assessee is required to file return electronically.
Vide Notification No. 43/2011 dt. 25th August 2011, every Assessee shall submit a half yearly return electronically.
Assessees can file service tax return online at registering at https://www.aces.gov.in.
With effect from 1st October, 2011, every assessee is required to file half yearly return electronically.

Revision of Returns
As per Rule 7B, an assessee may submit a revised return, in Form ST-3, in triplicate, to correct a mistake or
omission, within a period of ninety days from the date of submission of the return under rule 7.

Penalty for not filing and late Filing of Return
If return of service tax is not filed within the prescribed period penalty is leviable under section 77(2) which can be
upto `10,000.
Rule 7C of Service Tax Rules, 1994 provides for penalty for delay in filing of service tax return. Accordingly late fee
is payable as follows:
Delay upto 15 days

` 500/-

Delay beyond 15 days and upto 30 days

` 1,000/-

Delay beyond 30 days

`1,000 + ` 100/- per day subject to a maximum of ` 20,000
[the penalty prescribed in section 70(1)]

Penalty for late filing of return is specifically prescribed in Rule 7C subject to section 70 therefore if late fee is paid
then no penalty prescribed under section 77(2) shall be leviable.

PENALTIES AND PROSECUTION
Various penalties have been provided under the Act. Section 83A empowers Central Excise Officer to adjudicate
penalty within such powers as may be conferred by CBEC, by issuing a notification.

(A) PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO PAY SERVICE TAX [SECTION 76]
Provisions of section 76 before Finance Act, 2015
Any person who fails to pay service tax, shall pay, in addition to such tax and the interest on that tax amount in
accordance with the provisions of section 75, a penalty which shall not be less than;
– one hundred rupees for every day during which such failure continues; or
– at the rate of one per cent. of such tax, per month, whichever is higher, starting with the first day after the
due date till the date of actual payment of the outstanding amount of service tax.
Provided that the total amount of the penalty payable in terms of this section shall not exceed 50% of the service
tax payable.
Example
X, an assessee, fails to pay service tax of `10 lakhs payable by 5th March. X pays the amount on 15th March. The
default has continued for 10 days. The penalty payable by X is computed as follows:– 1% of the amount of default for 10 days = 1 x 10,00,000 x 10/31 = `3,225.80 or
– Penalty calculated @ `100 per day for 10 days = `1,000
Penalty liable to be paid is ` 3,226.00.

Further, where the Commissioner (Appeals), the Appellate Tribunal or the court, as the case may be, modifies the
amount of service tax determined under sub-section (2) of section 73, then the amount of penalty payable under
sub-section (1) and the interest payable thereon under section 75 shall stand modified accordingly, and after taking
into account the amount of service tax so modified, the person who is liable to pay such amount of service tax, shall
also be liable to pay the amount of penalty and interest so modified.
Also, where the amount of service tax or penalty is increased by the Commissioner (Appeals), the Appellate
Tribunal or the court, as the case may be, over and above the amount as determined under sub-section (2) of
section 73, the time within which the interest and the reduced penalty is payable under clause (ii) of the second
provisio to sub-section (1) in relation to such increased amount of service tax shall be counted from the date of the
order of the Commissioner (Appeals), the Appellate Tribunal or the court, as the case may be.
Note : Sections 76 and 78 have been substituted and section 80 for waiver of penalty omitted.
Penalty Sections: Section 76 deals with normal (non fraud ) cases and section 78 with fraud cases. Section 80
allows waiver of penalty in some cases. But that has been omitted. The effect is now there is no waiver of penalty
except as provided under the other provisions. For example, penalty is waived in normal cases under section 76 if
the amount of tax and interest if any, is paid within 30 days of receiving notice.
As per these new sections, 76 and 78, waiver or reduction of penalty is based on time of payment.
The following table elucidates:

TRANSITORY PROVISION [SECTION 78B]
After section 78A of the Finance 1994 Act, transitory provision i.e. section 78B has been inserted vide Finance Act,
2015 which provides that where in any case(a) service tax has not been levied or paid or has been short-levied or short-paid or erroneously refunded and
no notice has been served under sub-section (1) of section 73 or under the proviso thereto, before the date
on which the Finance Bill, 2015 received the assent of the President i.e before 14th May, 2015; or
(b) service tax has not been levied or paid or has been short-levied or short-paid or erroneously refunded and
a notice has been served under sub-section (1) of section 73 or under the proviso thereto, but no order has
been passed under sub-section (2) of section 73, before the date on which the Finance Bill, 2015 received
the assent of the President i.e before 14th May, 2015,
Then, in respect of such cases, the provisions of section 76 or section 78, as the case may be, as amended by the
Finance Act, 2015 shall be applicable.
(2) In cases where show cause notice has been issued under sub-section (1) of section 73 or under the proviso

counted from the date on which the Finance Bill, 2015 received the assent of the President i.e. 14th May, 2015.

PROSECUTION
Section 89 was inserted by Finance Act, 2011 which provides for offences which can lead to prosecution. The
prosecution was introduced in service tax to promote self compliance among the assessee. Further, sections 9A,
9AA, 9B, 9E and 34A of the Central Excise Act, 1944 have been made applicable service tax. These provisions
together constitute the provisions relating to prosecution of offences.

CENVAT CREDIT RULES, 2004
The CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004 have replaced the existing Cenvat Credit Rules, 2002 and Service tax Credit
Rules, 2002 with effect from 10th September 2004. The new Rules integrated services with goods. With the
introduction of these rules, inter sectoral credit is allowed to be taken. Service tax paid on input service is allowed
to be used for duty payable on final products removed. Similarly, excise duty paid on inputs is allowed to be used
for paying service tax on output service.
Example:
Duty paid on raw plastic for the manufacture of plastic furniture is ` 20,000 and service tax paid on transportation
i.e Goods Transport Agency of raw plastic of ` 10,000. The duty payable on the finished goods (plastic furniture) is
` 35,000 while paying the duty on plastic furniture; the manufacturer is allowed to deduct the amount already paid
as excise duty and service tax (Input tax) on raw plastic. Thus, the net duty payable will be `5,000 only. Technically
speaking, the manufacturer availed the cenvat credit to the extent of ` 30,000 that he paid on inputs and input
service for manufacturing of plastic furniture.
Note: The provisions of CENVAT Credit Rules will be covered in detail at Professional Programme.

ROLE OF COMPANY SECRETARIES
There is a great scope for Company Secretaries in Practice in the area of service tax. A Practicing Company
Secretary can render several services under the Service Tax such as;
– Consultancy services: The company secretaries can provide expertise services to their clients by explaining
and interpreting the provisions of the transformed and upcoming legislations. For Example, the taxability
of services shifted from selective approach to negative approach.
– Compliance Services: The Company Secretaries can help the client or employers to comply with the
following procedural requirement:
(a) Registration
(b) Payment of tax
(c) Maintenance of books and records
(d) Availment and utilization of Cenvat Credit
(e) Submissions of service tax returns.
– Certified Facilitation Centres (CFCs): Company Secretaries in Practice can set up CFCs under the
Automation of Central Excise and Service Tax Project of CBEC to provide procedural compliance services
to the assessees by charging fees.

LESSON ROUND UP
– Registration of service tax: Section 69 of the Finance Act, read with Rule 4 of the Service Tax Rules
make provisions relating to registration. It is mandatory for every person liable to pay service tax to get
registered with Superintendent of Central Excise. A person providing a taxable service is liable to pay
service tax in terms of Section 68.
– An application for registration to the Superintendent of Central Excise can be made in form (ST-1). This is
to be made within a period of thirty days from the date on which the service tax is leviable.
– Payment of service tax: With effect from 1st April 2011, Finance Act, 2011 introduced Point of Taxation
(POT) Rules, 2011. These rules laid down the provisions relating to payment of service tax on accrual
basis instead of receipt basis and specify the relevant date for determining rate of service tax. Point of
taxation means the point in time when a service shall be deemed to have been provided. This Point of time
will determine rate of service tax and due date of payment of service tax.
– Reverse charge- As per Section 68, every person providing taxable services i.e. provider of output service
is liable to pay service tax. But in special cases other person is liable to pay service tax. This is known
as reverse charge. Under this charge other person liable to pay service tax has to register himself under
service tax. Further, he can not claim general exemption limit of 10 Lakhs rupees and he is liable to pay
service tax even on small amount.
– Section 67 provides for the method of valuation of taxable services i.e. the value on which service provider
is required to discharge service tax. As per section 67, the valuation of taxable service shall be determined
under the following two situations:
– Service tax is separately charged in the bill
– Bill value is inclusive of service tax
– Abatement under service tax laws means that for certain services, a specified percentage of discount is

Lesson 17

Levy, Collection and Payment of Service Tax

773

allowed from the gross amount collected for rendering the services subject to the conditions that CENVAT
Credit has not been availed by the service provider.
– Adjustment of Service tax: Where an assessee has paid to the credit of Central Government any
amount in excess of the amount required to be paid towards service tax liability for a month or quarter, the
assessee may adjust such excess amount paid by him against his service tax liability for the succeeding
month or quarter.
– Maintenance of Accounts: Every assessee is required to furnish to the Superintendent of Central Excise
at the time of filing his return for the first time, a list of all accounts maintained by him in relation to service
tax including memoranda received from his branch offices.
– Filing of return: Rule 7 of the Service Tax Rules,1994 return under Service Tax is required to be filed by
every assessee on half yearly basis in Form ST-3 or Form ST-3A, as the case may be, along with a copy
of the Form GAR -7, in triplicate for the months covered in the half-yearly return. Every assessee shall
submit the half yearly return by the 25th of the month following the particular half-year.
– E-filing of return: With effect from 1st October, 2011, every assessee is required to file half yearly return
electronically.
– Interest on late payment of service tax: Every person, liable to pay the tax in accordance with the
provisions of section 68 or rules made thereunder, who fails to credit the tax or any part thereof to the
account of the Central Government within the period prescribed, shall pay simple interest at such rate not
below 10% and not exceeding 36% p.a.
– Doctrine of unjust enrichment: Since service tax is indirect tax, it is recoverable from customer. If you
recover the amount from customer and again claim refund, you will get double benefit. Hence, provision of
‘unjust enrichment’ has been made in the law. As per the doctrine of unjust enrichment, refund will be
granted to assessee only if assessee had not passed on the tax burden to your customer/client. It will be
presumed that assessee has passed on the burden of service tax.
– Penalties: Various penalties have been provided under the Act. The penalties can be imposed by Central
Excise Officers. There is no provision for prosecution under the Act.
– Role of Company Secretaries: The educational background, knowledge, training and exposure that a
Company Secretary has, makes him a versatile professional capable of rendering a wide range of
services to companies of all sizes, other commercial and industrial organizations, small scale units,
firms etc.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES

– Introduction

Value Added Tax (VAT) is a multi point tax added
to the goods at each step of the production and
distribution process. Ever since 1954, when the
Value added tax was first introduced in France,
it has spread to over 160 countries in the world.
In India, the Committee of Finance Minister (in
1995 and 1998) had put forward recommendations
to replace sales tax by Value Added Tax (VAT).

– VAT Regime
– Registration
– Composition Scheme of VAT
– Tax Invocie
– Advantages

One of the reasons underlying the shift to VAT
regime was to do away with the distortions in our
earlier tax structure. Since, VAT is a multi-stage
tax levied at each stage of the value addition chain,
with a provision to allow input tax credit (ITC) on
tax paid at an earlier stage.

– Variants of VAT
– Computation of VAT
– Exempted sale
– Zero Rating

– Central Sales Tax

Unlike service tax, VAT is governed by the State
Government by separate VAT Act passed by each
of the state under the guidelines issued by an
Empowered Committee of State Finance
Ministers to ensure uniformity. Therefore, the
procedure for VAT Registration, the VAT Rates,
due date for VAT payment, deadline for VAT Return
Filing and other modalities differ from State to
State.

INTRODUCTION
The Value Added Tax (VAT) in India is a state level multi-point tax on value addition which is collected at different
stages of sale with a provision for set-off for tax paid at the previous stage i.e., tax paid on inputs. It is to be levied
as a proportion of the value added (i.e. sales minus purchase) which is equivalent to wages plus interest, other
costs and profits. It is a tax on the value added and can be aptly defined as one of the ideal forms of consumption
taxation since the value added by a firm represents the difference between its receipts and cost of purchased
inputs. Value Added Tax is commonly referred to as a method of taxation whereby the tax is levied on the value
added at each stage of the production/distribution chain. As against the existing regime under which goods are
charged to tax at single point, or multi-point on the value of the goods, without any credit being given for taxes paid
at the preceding stages. VAT intends to tax only the value added at each stage. By ensuring that only the incremental
value is taxed, VAT aims at eliminating the cascading effect of taxes on commodities, and thereby reduces the
eventual cost to the consumer.
It is one of the most radical reforms, albeit only in the sphere of State level taxes on sale, those have been initiated
for the Indian economy after years of political and economic debate aiming to replace complicated tax structure and
do away with the fraudulent practices.
With the objective to introduce State-Level VAT in India in the Year 1992, the Government of India constituted a Tax
Reform Committee headed by Dr. Raja J. Chelliah. In 1993, the Committee recommended the introduction of VAT
in place of existing tax system. Thereafter, the Government appointed NIPFP (National Institute of Public Finance
and Policy), New Delhi, as the Nodal Agency to work out the modalities of VAT.
The first preliminary discussion on State-Level VAT took place in 1995, in a meeting of Chief Ministers convened by
Dr. Manmohan Singh, the then Union Finance Minister. In this meeting, the basic issues on VAT were discussed in
general terms and recommendation to replace sales tax by Value Added Tax was put forth. After this, periodic
interactions of State Finance Ministers were held.
Thereafter, on November 16, 1999, in a significant meeting of all Chief Ministers convened by Shri Yashwant Sinha,
the then Union Finance Minister, three important decisions were taken. First, before the introduction of State-level
VAT, the unhealthy sales tax rate “war” among the States would have to end and sales tax rates would need to be
harmonized by implementing uniform floor rates of sales tax for different categories of commodities with effect from
January 1, 2000. Second, in the interest of harmonization of incidence of sales tax, the sales-tax related industrial
incentive schemes would also have to be discontinued with effect from January 1, 2000. Third, on the basis of
achievement of the first two objectives steps would be taken by the states for introduction of State-level VAT after
adequate preparation.
For implementing the VAT, an Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers was set-up. Thereafter, this
Empowered Committee met frequently and got full support from the State Finance Ministers, the Finance Secretaries
and the Commissioners of Commercial Taxes of the State Governments as well as Senior Officials of the Revenue
Department of the Ministry of Finance, Government of India. Through repeated discussions and collective efforts of
all, it was possible to achieve remarkable success within a period of about one and half years. After reaching this
stage, steps were initiated for the systematic preparation for the introduction of State-Level VAT.
Along with these measures ensuring convergence on the basis issues on VAT, steps were taken for necessary
training, computerization and interaction with trade and industry, particularly at the State level. The conference of
Chief Minister and the Finance Minister proposed introduction of VAT with uniform floor rates and the Empowered
Committee of State Finance Ministers on February 8, 2003 again endorsed the suggestion that all the State
legislations on VAT should have a certain minimum set of common features and most of the States came out with
their respective draft legislations. Thereafter, Shri Jaswant Singh the then Union Finance Minister, announced the
introduction of VAT from 1st April, 2003 in his 2003-2004 budget speech made on February 28, 2003.

However, owing to some unavoidable circumstances, VAT could not be implemented w.e.f. 1st April, 2003, and the
date of introduction of VAT was thus revised to 1st June, 2003
Despite all obstacles, Haryana implemented VAT w.e.f. April 1, 2003 and became the first state in India to implement
VAT.
With the introduction of VAT, all sales or purchases of goods made within the State except the exempted goods are
subjected to VAT as a consumption tax.

WHITE PAPER
The Empowered Committee of the State Finance Ministers constituted by the Ministry of Finance, Government of
India, on the basis of the resolution adopted in the conference of the Chief Ministers on November 16, 1999 under
the Chairmanship of Dr. Asim Dasgupta came out with a White Paper on State-Level VAT, which was released on
January 17, 2005 by Shri P. Chidambaram, The Finance Minister, Government of India. On this occasion the
Finance Minister remarked :
“This is the first document which has been collectively prepared and put out to the people of the country by the
Finance Ministers of all States…. We have formed the rainbow coalition to undertake one of the biggest tax
reforms.”
This Paper consists of three parts. In Part I, justification of VAT and the background has been mentioned. In Part II,
main design of VAT as evolved on the basis of consensus among the States through repeated discussions in the
Empowered Committee has been elaborated. In Part III, other related issues for effective implementation of VAT
have been discussed.
In his speech introducing Union Budget 2005-06, the Hon’ble Finance Minister also said, “In a remarkable display
of the spirit of cooperative federalism, the States are poised to undertake the most important tax reform ever
attempted in this country. All States have agreed to introduce the Value Added Tax with effect from 1st April, 2005.
VAT is a modern, simple and transparent tax system that will replace the existing sales tax and eliminate the
cascading effect of sales tax.
In the medium to long term, it is my goal that the entire production/distribution chain should be covered by a
national VAT, or even better, a goods and services tax, encompassing both the Centre and the States. The Empowered
Committee of the State Finance Ministers, with the solid support of the Chief Ministers, has laboured through the
last seven years to arrive at a framework acceptable to all States. The Central Government has promised its full
support and has also agreed to compensate the States, according to an agreed formula, in the event of any revenue
loss. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Empowered Committee, and wish the States success on the
introduction and implementation of VAT”.

KELKAR COMMITTEE REPORT
Considering that the implementation of VAT was closely linked to the administration of other indirect taxes and
impacts the tax to GDP ratio, it had become necessary to examine the relevant issues. In this direction the Task
Force has had the benefit of meeting with the Empowered Committee of the Finance Ministers of the States,
constituted for the purpose of implementing a nationwide State-level VAT. The Empowered Committee experimented
on federal fiscal planning and achieved much in terms of building a consensus on many of the critical issues
relating to implementation of VAT in a relatively short spell of time. Most countries have taken several years to
implement VAT. Decisions were taken on the important features of VAT relating to replacement of the State Tax
levied by the States though some other local taxes like octroi, mandi, cess etc. may continue.
It was recommended that a public awareness programme shall be started jointly by the Central Government and
the State Governments. The Central Government shall extend financial support for this, if needed. Since the State
VAT is expected to be implemented from 1.4.2003, it was also necessary that the public awareness programme
should be implemented at the earliest.
One of the issues which had impact on the transition of VAT was the compensation to be given to the States upon
the removal of Sales tax and the introduction of State VAT, in the event the tax revenue drops due to the changeover.
In this regard, it had been observed that the experience worldwide has been that a move towards VAT results in
higher revenue realization.
During the meetings that the Task Force had with several industry and trade bodies, it was represented that the
switch-over to VAT must ensure that the desired benefits were achieved, especially in view of the fact that this
switch-over entailed a major overhaul of systems and procedures for business and governments and at substantial
expenditure of money, time and effort.
Under the sales-tax structure, there were problems of double taxation of commodities and multiplicity of taxes
resulting in a cascading tax burden. As per the earlier structure before a commodity is produced, inputs were first
taxed and then after the commodity was produced with input tax load, output was taxed again. This caused an
unfair double taxable with cascading effects. In the VAT, a set-off is given for input tax as well as tax paid on
previous purchases.
The design of State-level VAT has been worked out by the Empowered Committee through several rounds of
discussions and striking a federal balance between the common points of convergence regarding VAT and flexibility
for the local characteristics of the States.
The Value Added Tax (VAT) is based on the value addition to the goods and the related VAT liability of the dealer is
calculated by deducting input tax credit from tax collected on sales during the payment period (say, a month).

VAT REGIME
– The rates shall be uniform. However, it is possible that items under the exempted category category may
be broadly similar across all States.

– Each State has its own VAT Act, Rules, Schedules, and Forms. therefore there will remain differences even
in definitions among various Acts.
– Petroleum products, like Aviation Turbine Fuel, Naphtha, etc. used as fuel for running automobiles are
brought under VAT, but credit cannot be taken on the tax paid thereon.
– Tobacco, Textiles and Sugar, which were under additional duty in lieu of excise and not under State
taxation, are brought into the State Tax net at a rate not more than 4%, thereby integrating these products
in the VAT structure.

REGISTRATION
Every dealer up to the retailer level is required to be registered with the Sales Tax department to avail the credit of
input tax. However, there is a threshold turnover level. The retailers with turnover below the threshold can opt not to
register, but pay a nominal composition tax. However, such dealers are not entitled to take credit of prior stage tax,
nor can they pass the credit to their buyers. In effect, the VAT chain breaks at their stage. Those opting not to
register under VAT can opt for general registration.
Registration of dealers with gross annual turnover above the threshold limit is compulsory. There is a provision for
voluntary registration for dealers with gross annual turnover of less than the threshold limit. All existing dealers will
be automatically registered under the VAT Act. A new dealer were allowed 30 days time from the date of his being
liable to get registered.
The White Paper specified that registration under the VAT Act shall not be compulsory for the small dealers with
gross annual turnover not exceeding Rs. 5 lakh. However, the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers
has subsequently allowed the States to increase the threshold limit for the small dealers to Rs. 10 lakh, but the
concerned State shall have to bear the revenue loss, on account of increase in the limit beyond Rs. 5 lakh.

COMPOSITION SCHEME OF VAT PAYMENT
Small dealers with gross annual turnover not exceeding the threshold limit will not be liable to pay VAT. States will have
flexibility to fix threshold limit within `10 lakh. Small dealers with annual gross turnover not exceeding `25 lakh who
are otherwise liable to pay VAT, shall however have the option for a composition scheme with payment of tax at a small
percentage of gross turnover. The dealers opting for this composition scheme will not be entitled to input tax credit.
The VAT regime has thus designed composition scheme so that high value taxpayers should not be spared and on
the contrary small dealers should be hassle free from compliance procedures. The objective of all such composition
schemes is not to burden small dealers by the provisions of record keeping. Therefore, such schemes will generally
contain the following features:
(i) small amount of tax shall be payable;
(ii) there shall be no requirement to calculate taxable turnover;

782 EP-TL&P
(iii) a simple return form to cover longer return period shall be sufficient.

This entire design of VAT with input tax credit is crucially based on documentation of tax invoice, cash memo or bill.
Every registered dealer, having turnover of sales above an amount specified, shall issue to the purchaser [who is
entitled to tax credit and not to the final consumer] serially numbered tax invoice with the prescribed particulars.
This tax invoice will be signed and dated by the dealer or his regular employee, showing the required particulars.

ADVANTAGES
Various advantages of introducing VAT:
– to encourage and result in a better-administered system;
– to eliminate avenues of tax evasion;
– to avoid under valuation at all stages of production and distribution;
– to claim credit on tax paid on inputs at each stage of value addition;
– do away with cascading effect resulting in non distortion of the business decisions;
– to permit to easy and effective targeting of tax rates as a result of which the exports can be zero-rated;
– to ensure to better tax compliance by generating a trail of invoices that supports effective audit and
enforcement strategies;
– to contribute to fiscal consolidation for the country. As a steady source of revenue, it shall reduce the debt
burden in due course;
– to help our country to integrate better in the WTO regime;
– to stop the unhealthy tax-rate war and trade diversion among the States, which had adversely affected the
interests of all the States in the past.

VARIANTS OF VAT
1. Gross Product Variant: Tax is levied on all sales & deductions for tax paid on inputs (excluding capital goods)
is allowed. Thus, no deduction is allowed for taxes paid on capital inputs.
2. Income Variant: This allows deduction on purchase of raw materials and components as well as depreciation
on capital goods. This method provides incentives to classify purchases as current expenditure to claim set-off.
3. Consumption Variant: Tax is levied on all sales with deduction for tax paid on all business inputs (including
capital goods).

METHODS OF COMPUTATION
VAT can be computed by using any of the three methods detailed below:
1. The Subtraction method: Under this method the tax rate is applied to the difference between the value of
output and the cost of input.
2. The Addition method: Under this method value added is computed by adding all the payments that are
payable to the factors of production (viz., wages, salaries, interest payments, etc.).
3. Tax Credit method: Under this method, it entails set-off of the tax paid on inputs from tax collected on
sales. Indian States opted for tax credit method, which is similar to CENVAT.

Procedure
The VAT is based on the value addition to the goods and the related VAT liability of the dealer is calculated by:

Lesson 18

– Deducting input tax credit from tax collected on sales during the payment period.
– This input tax credit is given for both manufacturers and traders for purchase of input/supplies meant for both
sales within the State as well as to the other States irrespective of their date of utilization or
sale.
– If the tax credit exceeds the tax payable on sales in a month, the excess credit will be carried over to the
end of the next financial year.
– If there is any excess unadjusted input tax credit at the end of the second year then the same will be
eligible for refund.
– For all exports made out of the country, tax paid within the State will be refunded in full.
– Tax paid on inputs procured from other States through inter-State sale and stock transfer shall not be
eligible for credit.
– VAT has been introduced by in States / UTs. However, Central Sales Tax continues to govern inter-State
Sales and Exports.

3. Under which method is the rate of tax applied to the difference between the
value of output and the cost of input?
(a) Subtraction method
(b) Addition method
(c) Tax Credit method
(d) None of the above

Rates of Tax
Following Types of VAT Rates: As contrasted to the multiplicity of rates under the existing regime, VAT will have
following broad rates.
– Exempted for unprocessed agricultural goods, and goods of social importance;
– 1% for gold & silver ornaments, precious and semiprecious stones;
– 4% for inputs used for manufacturing and on declared goods, capital goods and other essential items,
– 20% for demerit/luxury goods; and
– Rest of the commodities will be taxed at a Revenue Neutral Rate of 12.5%.

EXEMPTED SALE
When a certain sale is exempted from tax, the dealer effecting the exempt sale will not be entitled to any VAT credit
on the inputs purchased by him. The sale effected by him will also be exempt from any tax. This results in breaking
of the VAT chain.

Samples or Gifts
Another example where reversal will be required is when goods are sold as samples or gifts i.e., non-taxable transactions
and the input tax credit relating thereto has already been availed against output tax payable on other sale transactions.
In such circumstances, the credit earned will be reversed. This is called “Reverse Credit of Input Tax”.

784 EP-TL&P

Stock Transfer
A registered dealer may send goods to its brances in other States. This is called ‘stock transfer’. Since inter-state
stock transfer does not involve sale. Such a transaction is generally not subject to payment of CST. The same
position is adopted by different States under the VAT regime. Generally, the tax paid on inputs used in manufacture
of finished goods which are stock transferred or purchase of goods which are stock transferred, is available as input
tax credit after retention of 2 percent of such tax by the concerned State Government. For example, if the tax paid
on input is 12.5%, credit of 10.5% is available. If the tax paid on input was 4%, input tax credit of 2% is available.

ZERO RATING
Zero Rating means that the tax payable on sale of a commodity is fixed at 0%. Though apparently, it looks similar to
an exempted transaction, there is a significant difference between the two. In an exempted transaction, the tax paid
on input lapses i.e. it cannot be set off while under the zero rated sales, prior stage tax is set off against the 0% tax
paid, and effectively the entire tax paid on purchases is eligible for refund. Thus, ‘Zero Rated’ is advantageous to the
dealer as compared to ‘exempted sale’ transactions. Generally, export sales are zero rated and thereby, exporters are
granted refund of taxes paid by them on their inputs. Exporters gain significantly due to the ‘Zero Rating’.
Refunds are to be granted by the end of the financial year. Thus, the benefit of zero rating is not immediate, but
deferred. Some States have also provided for refund where the tax paid on inputs exceeds the output tax payable
and cannot be set off in a given period. In such cases, the excess tax not so set off shall be refunded after adjusting
any dues towards interest, penalty, etc., in accordance with the State VAT Act.

CREDIT AND SET-OFF UNDER VAT
VAT aims at providing set-off for the tax paid earlier and this is given effect through the concept of input tax
credit.
Input tax credit in relation to any period means setting the amount of input tax by a registered dealer against the
amount of his output tax. Tax paid on the earlier point is termed as, “input tax”. This amount is adjusted against the
tax payable by the purchasing dealer on his sales. This credit availability is called input tax credit.
Input tax is the tax paid or payable in the course of business on purchase of any goods made from a registered
dealer of the State.
Output tax means the tax charged or chargeable under the Act, by a registered dealer for the sale of goods in the
course of business.
In simple words, input tax is the tax a dealer pays on his local purchases of business inputs which include raw
materials, capital goods as well as other inputs used directly or indirectly in his business. Output tax is the tax
that a dealer charges on his sales that are subject to tax.
The input tax credit is to be given to both manufacturers and traders for purchase of inputs/ supplies meant for sale
within the State as well as to other States, irrespective of when these were utilized or sold. Input tax paid in excess
of 2% on stock transfers to other states are also eligible for tax credit. It is also to be noted that in certain cases,
partial input tax credit is available in respect of input used for manufacture of exempted goods.
Input tax credit is allowable to a registered dealer for purchase of any goods made within the State from a dealer holding
a valid certificate of registration under the Act. Input tax credit on capital goods is available for traders and manufacturers.
No input credit on CST paid on purchases from other states: Central sales tax paid on inter-state purchases
is not eligible for being set off against Value Added Tax payable in the state.
Input tax on capital goods: While taxes paid on raw materials and inputs are eligible for set off against taxes on
output, taxes paid on capital goods are not eligible for immediate set-off. The reason perhaps is the huge credit that

Lesson 18

Value Added Tax – Introduction, Computation and Other Procedural Aspects
s

785

States may have to grant in cases of capital purchases of large value. Due to this, tax on capital goods may be
granted, but over a certain period of time.
Input tax in case of export sales: Export sales are zero rated and thereby exporters are either granted refund of
input taxes paid by them or they can adjust such input tax while making domestic sales.
In some cases, the input tax paid and taken credit of, may have to be reversed as such, for example, when the
material is consumed for personal purposes and not for business purposes, or when the input including packing
materials is used for manufacture and/or sale as exempt goods etc.

TAX ON WORK CONTRACT
The works contracts are quite different from the normal sales. In normal sale there is a transfer of property in definite
or ascertained goods. The goods remain same before and after the delivery of the goods. However, in works
contracts it does not happen. The goods before the delivery and after the execution of works contracts are different.
For example, at the site of construction of a building, before the Construction (works contract) commences, the
goods are like bricks, cement, steel etc. but after the Construction a building (immovable goods) comes to an
existence. This is often termed as “deemed sales” in the indivisible works contract. Some examples of works
contracts are construction of a Building, erection of Plant & Machinery, Processing jobs, Job works, Repair jobs,
Electrical Fittings, Annual maintenance Contracts (AMCs) etc.
The Supreme Court of India, in its judgment has confirmed the difference between a normal sale and an indivisible/
composite works contract;
“If the thing to be delivered has any individual existence before the delivery as the property of the party who is to
deliver it, then it is a sale. If the main object of the work undertaken is not the transfer of a Chattel qua Chattel,
the contract is one for work and labour” (Hindustan Shipyard – 119 STC 533-SC).
Further, Supreme Court in its landmark judgment in the case of Gammon & Dunkerely (9 STC 353) held that the
states cannot levy the Sales Tax on the indivisible works contracts as there is no sale. After which, the then
Finance Ministers of the States requested the then Union Finance Minister to take necessary legal steps so as to
facilitate levy Sales Tax on indivisible works contracts.
Finally, the 46th amendment to the Constitution of India has been made on 2nd February, 1983 to add a sub-article
(29-4) as under,
“(b) a tax on the transfer of property in goods (whether a goods or in some other form) involved in the execution
of a works contract”.
After the said amendment to the Constitution, the States were empowered to levy Sales Tax / Works Contract Tax
on such sales, called as “Deemed sales” involved in the execution of works contract. However, the tax could be
levied only on the `Material Value’ of the works contract. The High Courts and the Supreme Court have suggested
methods on “How to arrive at a material value from the total Contract Price”. (Gannon Dunkerly’s SC Judgement
1993 ) (88 STC 204).
After the implementation of VAT, the VAT States have incorporated in their respective State VAT Acts, the provisions
of ‘Works Contracts’ for levying the Sales Tax /VAT on the deemed sales involved in the execution of works
contracts i.e VAT on the Works Contract transactions (Deemed Sales). Just like sales tax, VAT is leviable on the
‘Material Value’ of the Contract. However, under VAT, the advantage to the contractors is that, they can avail VAT
set off / Credit of the VAT paid to the local vendors, which was not available in the Pre-VAT Regime.
Certain Works Contracts like construction contracts, civil Jobs, Annual Maintenance Contracts (AMCs) involve the
transfer of property in goods (sale of goods / materials) as well as rendering of Taxable Service because of which both
VAT & Service Tax are applicable on the Contract price. Thus, the both the state & the Central Governments levy VAT
& Service tax on the same taxable base i.e. Contract Price, respectively. However, under service tax laws, the
abatements are available for specific Taxable Services towards the value of material / goods involved in the same.

786 EP-TL&P

Inter-stare works contract
When the Contractor dispatches his goods from one State to another under an indivisible works contract, it is an
interstate works contract. For example, a Manufacturer in Mumbai dispatches his own material to a processor in
Surat and the processor returns back the processed material back to the Mumbai Manufacturer.
The Central Government amended the definition of ‘Sale’ under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 from 11.5.2002 with
the said amendment, the states were empowered to levy CST on the inter-state works contract. In interstate works
contracts too, the CST is payable only on the ‘Material Value/Price’ of the Contract.

ASSESSMENT
The VAT liability is self-assessed by the dealer himself. It pre-supposes that all the dealers act in honest manner.
Scrutiny may be done in cases where there are doubts arising due to under reporting of transactions or evasion of tax.

SCRUTINY PROCESS AND VAT AUDIT
There is no compulsory assessment at the end of each year. Correctness of self-assessment is checked through
a system of VAT Audit (departmental audit). It is a sample audit where, a certain percentage of the dealers are
taken up for audit every year on a scientific basis. In case of detection of evasions during the course of audits, the
concerned dealer may be taken up for audit for previous periods.
The Audit Wing is delinked from tax collection wing to remove any biasedness. The audit team conducts its work in a
time bound manner to complete the same within six months. The audit report is transparently sent to the dealer as well.
Simultaneously, a cross-checking through computerized system is done on the basis of coordination between the
tax authorities of the State Governments and the authorities of Central Excise to compare constantly the tax
returns and set-off documents of VAT system of the States and those of Central Excise. This comprehensive crosschecking system helps in reduction of tax evasions and also lead to significant growth of tax revenue.
In many states other than the Departmental Audit, audit of accounts by Accountant is made mandatory where the
turnover exceeds the prescribed limit.

RETURNS
The return filing procedures are designed in such a way that the compliance costs are minimum. A registered dealer
is required to file a return along with the requisite details such as output tax liability, value of input tax credit, and
payment of VAT.
Under VAT there exist simple forms of returns, which shall be filed monthly or quarterly or annually as per the
provisions of various State laws. Returns shall be accompanied with the challans evidencing payment of tax. In
certain States, returns cum challan forms have been devised. In those cases, the returns along with the payment
have to be filed with the treasury.

Lesson 18

s

787

Every return so furnished is required to be scrutinized expeditiously within the prescribed time limit from the date of
filing the return. If any technical mistake is detected on scrutinizing, the dealer shall be required to rectify the defect
or pay the deficit respectively.

APPEALS, REVISION AND APPEARANCES
In India there is no central Value Added Tax Act till now. Further, there is no consensus among states to introduce
a unique Act which will apply to all states and union territories without any reservation and constraints. The
eventuality is being separate states have their own VAT Act. Since different states and union territories have their
own VAT Act and Rules, the appeal, revision and other relevant issues are explained differently. As a result any
representative provisions relating to appeals, revision and appearances cannot be stated. It is worth mentioning that
some states have recognised company secretaries as authorised representative to represent their client’s case
before any VAT authority. Some other states are in the process of recognizing company secretaries as professionals
who can appear before their respective VAT authorities.

CENTRAL SALES TAX
Central sales tax (CST) is a tax on inter-state sales of goods levied by the Central Government of India. It extends to
the whole of India. The Central Sales Tax is levied by the Central Government but, it is collected by that state
government from where the goods were sold. The tax thus collected is given to the same state government which
collected the tax. In case of Union Territories the tax collected is deposited in the consolidated fund of India.
Every dealer who makes an inter-state sale must be a registered dealer and a certificate of registration has to be
displayed at all places of his business. There is no exemption limit of turnover for the levy of central sales tax.
CST is applicable only in the case of inter-state sales and not on sales made within the state or import/export of
sales. The interstate nature of transaction is to be determined as defined in Section 3(a)/(b) the Central Sales Tax
Act. If sale/purchase results in the movement of goods from one State to another State, it is an interstate sale.
Thus, consignments to agents or transfer of goods to branch or other offices are not a sale. A sale, effected by
transfer of documents of title to goods when goods are in inter-state movement, is also an inter-state sale.
However, goods which are sold within a state, but while travelling through another state is not considered as interstate sales.
Under this act, the goods have been classified as:
– Declared goods or goods of special importance in inter-state trade or commerce; and
– Other goods.
The rates of tax on declared goods are lower as compared to the rate of tax on goods in the second category.
The rules regarding submission of returns, payment of tax, appeals etc. are not given in the Act. For this purpose,
the rules followed by a state in respect of its own sales tax law shall be followed for purpose of this Act. Even though

788 EP-TL&P
the central sales tax has been framed by the central government, the state governments are allowed to frame such
rules, subject to such notification and alteration as it deem fit.

SOME IMPORTANT DEFINITIONS
Declared goods [section 2(c)]
It includes those goods which are considered to be of special importance in interstate trade or commerce under
section 14.Some of these goods is –
– cereals
– coal
– cotton
– crude oil
– jute
– oilseeds
– Pulses
– sugar
Goods [section 2(d)]
This includes all material articles or commodities and all kind of Movable property excluding newspapers, actionable
claims, stocks, shares and securities. If newspapers are sold as scrap then, it will be charged to central sales tax
if it is an inter- state sale.
Sale [section 2 (g)]
It means transfer of property in goods by one person to another for cash or for deferred payment or for any valuable
consideration. However, a mortgage, hypothecation of, or a charge, or pledge on goods is not included.
Essential elements of sale:
– goods should be transferred
– general property in good should be transferred
– price must be paid
– there must be a seller and a buyer
– there must be a valid consent of both buyer and seller
Sale price [section 2 (h)]
It means amount payable to a dealer as consideration for the sale of any Goods which includes the following –

– freight charges if, not shown separately
– any sum charged for anything done by the dealer in respect of goods at the time of or before delivery
thereof;
Sale price does not includes the following – freight or transport charges for delivery of goods, if charged separately
– cost of installations, if charged separately
– cash discounts for making timely payments.
– trade discount
– insurance charges of goods insured on behalf of the buyer
– goods rejected
– goods returned within 6 months of the date of sale
Turnover [section 2 (j)]
It is the aggregate of the sale prices received and receivable by the dealer In respect of sales of any goods in the
course of inter-state trade or commerce made during a prescribed period. Prescribed period is the period in which
sales tax return is filed.
Section 4 of the CST Act determines situs of sale: i.e. State in which the sale takes place. Accordingly the situs is
to be decided on the location of the goods at the time of sale.
Section 5 defines the sale/purchase taking place in course of import/export and such transactions are immune
from levy of any tax by State Government or Central Government. [(Sections 5(1), 5(2) and 5(3)].
The sale of goods to any exporter for the purpose of complying with the pre-existing order and covered by Section
5(3) is also exempt as deemed export. These sales are to be supported by Form H along with export order details
and copy of bill of lading etc. as evidence of actual export.
Determination of Turnover
As per section 8 (A) , to determine turnover following amounts will be deducted –
– Central sales tax
– Sale price of goods returned within six months
– Other items as the central government may notify
Central Sales Tax
If tax forms a part of aggregate sales price then amount of tax collected by a registered dealer shall be deducted
from his gross turnover. Tax is calculated by the following formula.
Rate of tax x Aggregate of sales price
100 ÷ Rate of tax
If the turnover of a dealer is taxable at different rates, then above formula shall be applied separately in respect of
each part of the turnover liable to a different rate of tax.

Registration of Dealers
According to Section 7, registration of dealer can be done in any of the two ways1. Compulsory registration

790 EP-TL&P
2. Voluntary registration

WITHDRAWAL OF CENTRAL SALES TAXES
Presently, CST continues, though it is proposed to be phased out in due course. The provisions in respect of
Central Tax are summarized below :
(i) CST may go after decision in respect of loss of revenue to States is taken and comprehensive Taxation
information System is put in place [Para 4.3 of White Paper on State-Level VAT]. Note that CST has been
reduced to 3% w.e.f. 1.4.2007, and further reduced to 2% w.e.f. 1.6.2008.
(ii) The forms under CST, i.e., C, E-I/E-II and H are still being used however, Form No. D has been abolished
w.e.f. 1.4.2007.
(iii) There is no credit of CST paid on inter-state purchases [Para 2.6 of White Paper on State-Level VAT]
(iv) If goods are sent on stock transfer outside the State, input tax paid in excess of 2% is allowed as credit.
In other words, input tax to the extent of 2% is not allowed as credit if goods are sent inter-state.

DISTINCTION BETWEEN CENTRAL SALES TAX (CST) AND VAT
S.No.

CST System

VAT System

1. Earlier the local sales tax was based on single
point tax. The single point tax was either at first
point or at last point. The First point tax (FPT) was
convenient to the revenue but had inbuilt cascading
effect. The Last Point Tax (LPT) is an ideal system
but it was evasion prone. Creates loss of revenue
to the government.

The VAT system on the other hand reduces the
disadvantages of both FPT and LPT and at the
same time draws the advantages from both. The
VAT system obviously is more transparent, uniform
and less prone to tax evasion.

2. States continue to tax declared goods on single
at point basis under the existing system subject to
a rate of 2%.

Under VAT, declared goods will also suffer tax at
multiple levels

3. Under the existing Sales tax systems, inputs
used for manufacture, whether capital or otherwise,
are eligible for concessional rate of tax on
furnishing the requisite forms.

However, under the VAT system, there is no place
for concessions. Goods will be taxed at their
respective rates, of course, with a provision for set
off in future. There will be no incentive schemes
under VAT, barring those carried forward from the
existing system.

4. The exports are exempt from tax and supplies
to exporters i.e. penultimate sales are also
exempt subject to certain conditions.

Under VAT, exports are zero rated i.e. they are not
exempted, giving rise to refund of tax paid on inputs.

5. There is no set off of prior taxes paid under the
existing system of Single Point Tax and Multipoint tax.

In the VAT system, all prior taxes are given setoff
against output tax if the sale is not an exempt
sale.

The following illustration may show the difference between first point tax and last point tax.
Assume the base price of the commodity is `1000 and the government wishes to collect sales tax of 10% on base
price i.e. `100.

GOODS AND SERVICE TAX
One of the biggest taxation reforms in India, the” Goods and Service Tax (GST)” is all set to integrate State
economies and boost overall growth. The GST is a comprehensive destination based tax levy on manufacture, sale
and consumption of goods and services at a national level which will subsume other indirect taxes such as octroi,
Central Sales Tax, State-level sales tax, entry tax, stamp duty, telecom licence fees, turnover tax, tax on consumption
or sale of electricity, taxes on transportation of goods and services, etc. thus avoiding multiple layers of taxation
that currently exist in India.
Introduction of the Value Added Tax (VAT) at the Central and the State level has been considered to be a major step
and important breakthrough in the sphere of indirect tax reforms in India. If the VAT is a major improvement over the
pre-existing Central excise duty at the national level and the sales tax system at the State level, then the Goods
and Services Tax (GST) will indeed be a further significant improvement the next logical step towards a comprehensive
indirect tax reforms in the country.
“GST is expected to play a transformative role in the way our economy functions. It will add buoyancy to our
economy by developing a common Indian market and reducing the cascading effect on the cost of goods and
services. We are moving in various fronts to implement GST from the next year”
-Arun Jaitley, Budget Speech, 2015
GST is expected to create a single, unified Indian market to make the economy stronger. The introduction of Goods
and Services Tax (GST) at the Central level will not only include comprehensively more indirect Central taxes and
integrate goods and service taxes for the purpose of set-off relief, but may also lead to revenue gain for the Centre
through widening of the dealer base by capturing value addition in the distributive trade and increased compliance.
Despite the success of VAT, there are still certain shortcomings in the structure of VAT both at the Central and at
the State level. The shortcoming in CENVAT of the Government of India lies inter-alia in several taxes which are in
the nature of indirect tax on goods and services, such as luxury tax, entertainment tax, etc., and yet not subsumed
in the VAT and thus keeping the benefits of comprehensive input tax and service tax set-off out of reach for
manufacturers/dealers.

792 EP-TL&P
GST is not simply VAT plus service tax rather it is an improvement over the previous system of VAT and disjointed service
tax. The essence of GST is that the cascading effects of both CENVAT and service tax will be removed with set-off, and
a continuous chain of set-off from the original producer’s point and service provider’s point upto the retailer’s level will be
established which will reduce the burden of all cascading effects. The GST may usher in the possibility of a collective
gain for industry, trade, agriculture and common consumers as well as for the Central Government and the State
Governments. The GST may, indeed, lead to the possibility of collectively positive-sum game.

Important Events
28th February, 2007: An announcement was made by the then Union Finance Minister in the Central Budget (200708) to the effect that GST would be introduced with effect from April 1, 2010.



Restrictions on imposition of tax: The Constitution imposes certain restrictions on states on the imposition
of tax on the sale or purchase of goods. The Bill amends this provision to restrict the imposition of tax on
the supply of goods and services and not on its sale.



Additional Tax on supply of goods: An additional tax (not to exceed 1%) on the supply of goods in the
course of inter-state trade or commerce would be levied and collected by the centre. Such additional tax
shall be assigned to the states for two years, or as recommended by the GST Council.



arising out of the implementation of the GST, on the GST Council’s recommendations. This would be up to
a five year period.

Draft Model GST Law
Recently, on June 14, 2016, the Government has put the Draft Model GST Law on public domain after getting inprinciple nod from the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers, in a way, signalling that the GST might
mark its advent from April 1, 2017.
The Draft Model GST Law is a model, which the Central Government and each of the State Governments would use
to draft their respective Central and State GST Acts. Further, a Draft of the Integrated GST (IGST) Act, 2016 [“Draft
IGST Act”], which will govern levy of GST on inter-State supplies by the Central Government, is also issued.
The Draft Model GST Law provides an insight on the governing provisions regarding levy and collection of GST. It
also states that the Act shall be referred as the Central/ State Goods and Services Tax Act, 2016. The Draft Model
GST Law consists of 162 clauses divided into 25 Chapters along with 4 schedules and Rules as to Valuation under
GST. Further, the Draft IGST Act consists of 33 clauses divided into 11 Chapters.
Key Highlights of the Draft Model GST Law are as follows:
Levy of, and Exemption from, GST:
– Levy and collection of Central GST (“CGST”)/ State GST (“SGST”)and Integrated GST (“IGST”)
1. On Intra-State supplies of goods and/ or services: CGST & SGST shall be levied by the Central and
State Government respectively, at the rate to be prescribed;
2. On Inter-State supplies of goods and/ or services: IGST shall be levied by the Central Government at
the rate to be prescribed.
– Reverse charge basis:
Notification may be issued for providing specific categories of supply of goods and/or services, on which,
GST is payable by the person receiving such goods and/ or services, on reverse charge basis.
– Composition levy
A registered taxable person, whose aggregate turnover in a financial year does not exceed Rs. 50 lakhs,
shall be provided an option to pay, in lieu of the tax payable by him, an amount calculated at such rate as
may be prescribed, but not less than 1% of the turnover during the year, subject to certain conditions.
– Taxable person - Threshold limit to pay tax
A person is liable to pay tax if his aggregate turnover in a financial year exceeds Rs. 10 lakhs. However, a

Lesson 18

Value Added Tax – Introduction, Computation and Other Procedural Aspects
s

795

person conducting business in any of the North Eastern States including Sikkim, is required to pay tax if
his aggregate turnover exceeds Rs. 5 lakhs.
The Central Government, a State Government or any Local Authority shall be regarded as a taxable person
in respect of activities or transactions in which they are engaged as public authorities other than the
activities or transactions as specified in Schedule IV to this Act, like activities of issuance of passport,
visa, birth certificate etc.
Registration:
– Threshold limit: A supplier is required to get registered under the GST if his aggregate turnover in a Financial
Year exceeds Rs. 9 lakhs and Rs. 4 Lakhs where business is conducted in any of the North Eastern
States including Sikkim.
No threshold exemption for persons making Inter-State supply and those who are required to pay GST
under reverse charge mechanism.
– Place of registration: A supplier has to take registration in the State from where taxable goods and/or
services are supplied.
Taxable Event:
The taxable event under the GST regime shall be supply of goods and/ or services. Thus, meaning of the term
‘supply’ plays a crucial role since under GST, tax would be levied on supply of goods & services and the present
concepts of manufacture/ rendering of services/ sale would lose its relevance.
Meaning and scope of ‘supply’: ‘Supply’ includes:
– All forms of supply of goods and/or services such as sale, transfer, barter, exchange, license, rental, lease
or disposal made or agreed to be made for a consideration by a person in the course or furtherance of
business.
– Importation of service, whether or not for a consideration and whether or not in the course or furtherance of
business.
– A supply specified in Schedule I, made or agreed to be made without a consideration. Schedule I covers
matter to be treated as supply like permanent transfer/disposal of business assets, supply of goods and/
or services by a taxable person to another taxable or non-taxable person in the course or furtherance of
business etc.
Point of taxation:
– Time of supply of goods: CGST/SGST shall be payable at the earliest of the following:
a) Date on which the goods are removed for supply to the recipient (in case of movable goods); or
b) Date on which the goods are made available to the recipient (in case of immovable goods); or
c) Date of issuing invoice by supplier; or
d) Date of receipt of payment by supplier, or
e) Date on which recipient shows the receipt of the goods in his books of account.
Time of supply of services: The time of supply of services shall be as under:
– The date of issue of invoice or the date of receipt of payment, whichever is earlier, if the invoice is issued
within the prescribed period; or
– The date of completion of the provision of service or the date of receipt of payment, whichever is earlier, if
the invoice is not issued within the prescribed period; or

796 EP-TL&P
– The date on which the recipient shows the receipt of services in his books of account, in a case where the
provisions of (i) or (ii) do not apply.
Place of supply of goods and/ or services:
Since, the proposed GST framework will work on the principle of destination based consumption tax, place of
supply rules plays an important role to build up a mechanism to determine taxable jurisdictions for the smooth
implementation of GST. It becomes more important in case of Inter-State transactions and e-commerce transactions.
Thus, the relevant provisions have been prescribed for determining the place of supply of goods and/ or services
under Chapter IV of the Draft IGST Act.
Determination of the Value of supply of goods and services:
In this regard, Draft GST Valuation (Determination of the Value of Supply of Goods and Services) Rules, 2016, has
been prescribed, which shall apply to the supply of goods and/or services under the IGST/CGST/SGST Act.
Methods prescribed for determination of value of supply are as follows :
a) Transaction Value Method : The value of goods and/or services shall be the transaction value i.e. the value
determined in monetary terms.
b) Comparison Method : Where value of supply cannot be determined under the Transaction Value Method,
the value shall be determined on the basis of transaction value of goods and/or services of like kind and
quality supplied at or about the same time to customers.
c) Computed Value Method : Where value cannot be determined under the Comparison method, it shall be
based on a computed value which shall include cost of production, manufacture or processing of the goods
or, the cost of the provision of services, the charges, if any, for design & brand and amount towards profit &
general expenses equal to that usually reflected in supply of goods and/or services of the same class or
kind as the goods and/or services being valued which are made by other suppliers.
d) Residual Method : Where the value cannot be determined under the Computed Value method, the value
shall be determined using reasonable means consistent with the principles and general provisions of the
Valuation Rules.
e) Valuation in certain cases: Provisions prescribed in relation to the valuation in the case of Pure Agent (such
as exclusion of the expenditure or costs incurred by the service provider as a pure agent of the recipient of
service subject to the fulfilment of the conditions);
Money Changer (such as for a currency, when exchanged from, or to, Indian Rupees (INR), the value shall
be equal to the difference in the buying rate or the selling rate, as the case may be, and the Reserve Bank
of India (RBI) reference rate for that currency at that time, multiplied by the total units of currency, etc.) are
also prescribed under the Draft Valuation Rules.

Payment of tax, interest, penalty and other amounts
Every deposit towards tax, interest, penalty, fee or any other amount by a taxable person shall be made by internet
banking or by using credit/debit cards or National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) or Real Time Gross Settlement

LESSON ROUND UP
Background: The Value Added Tax (VAT) in India is a state level multi-point tax on value addition which is
collected at different stages of sale with a provision for set-off for tax paid at the previous stage i.e., tax paid on
inputs. It is to be levied as a proportion of the value added (i.e. sales minus purchase) which is equivalent to
wages plus interest, other costs and profits. It is a tax on the value added and can be aptly defined as one of the
ideal forms of consumption taxation since the value added by a firm represents the difference between its
receipts and cost of purchased inputs.
Registration: Registration of dealers with gross annual turnover above the threshold limit is compulsory. There
is provision for voluntary registration for dealers with gross annual turnover of less than the threshold limit.
Advantages of VAT: Encourage a better-administered system; Eliminate tax evasion; Avoid under valuation;
avail tax credit; do away with cascading effect; permits easy and effective targeting of tax rates; ensures better
tax compliance; contribution to fiscal consolidation for the country
Variants of VAT : Gross product, income and consumption variant.

Methods of VAT: Subtraction method, Addition method and Tax Credit method.
Rate of VAT:
– Exempted for unprocessed agricultural goods, and goods of social importance),
– 1% for precious and semiprecious metals,
– 4% for inputs used for manufacturing and on declared goods, capital goods and other essential items,
– 20% for demerit/luxury goods and
– The rest of the commodities will be taxed at a Revenue Neutral Rate of 12.5%.
Exempted Sale: When a certain sale is exempted from tax, the dealer effecting the exempt sale will not be
entitled to any VAT credit on the inputs purchased by him
VAT Credit: VAT aims at providing set-off for the tax paid earlier and this is given effect through the concept of
input tax credit.
Works Contract Tax: Some contracts are contracts for labour, work or service and not for sale of goods. The
VAT is levied on the material value of the contract.
VAT Audit: There is no longer be compulsory assessment at the end of each year. Correctness of self-assessment
shall be checked through a system of Department Audit. A certain percentage of the dealers shall be taken up
for audit every year on a scientific basis
Filing of Return: The return filing procedures are designed in such a way that the compliance costs are
minimum. A registered dealer is required to file a return along with the requisite details such as output tax
liability, value of input tax credit, and payment of VAT.
Central Sales Tax: Central sales tax (CST) is a tax on sales of goods levied by the Central Government of
India. It extends to the whole of India. Every dealer who makes an inter-state sale must be a registered dealer
and a certificate of registration has to be displayed at all places of his business.
Withdrawal of CST: Presently, CST will continue, though it is proposed to be phased out in due course.
Goods and Service Tax: The GST is a comprehensive destination based tax levy on manufacture, sale and
consumption of goods and services at a national level which will subsume other indirect taxes such as octroi,
Central Sales Tax, State-level sales tax, entry tax, stamp duty, telecom licence fees, turnover tax, tax on
consumption or sale of electricity, taxes on transportation of goods and services, etc. thus avoiding multiple
layers of taxation that currently exist in India.

In this chapter the VAT provisions in different
countries and corresponding practices in GST
Scheme or VAT Scheme has been adequately
covered. It has been observed that the standard
practice in the developed countries relating to
Sales Tax is to follow the GST Scheme. The
practice depends upon the peculiarities of
individual countries or trade blocks as well as
the International Trading System of goods and
services. The Chapter also covers the poignant
role, the Company Secretaries play in their
professional capacity before any VAT authorities
in our country. As a matter of fact, it is also being
observed that the acceptability of company
secretaries before the VAT authorities is
increasing day by day.

The VAT was first introduced at a national level in France in 1954. Its original coverage was limited, and
France did not move to a full VAT that reached the broader retail sector until 1968. The second phase of VAT
adoption occurred from the late 1980s with the introduction of VAT in some high-profile industrialized countries
outside the EU, such as Australia, Canada, Japan, and Switzerland. This phase also witnessed the massive
expansion of VAT in transitional and developing economies, most notably in Africa and Asia. In the early 20th
century, the VAT has been adopted by more than 140 countries and accounts for approximately 20 percent of
worldwide tax revenue.

THE VAT SYSTEM
The VAT system is increasingly applied by different states of our country as an alternative to the existing Sales Tax
System. The Empowered Committee on VAT under the Chairmanship of Dr. Ashim Kumar Dasgupta justified the
implementation of VAT System in our country. The development of VAT System in our country is not according to
the expectation of the Empowered Committee. Initially there was some apprehension in some states of the danger
of losing revenue to other states, if VAT was implemented. As a result the development of VAT system took more
time than it was reasonably required for. As of now, all states and union territories, adopted the VAT regime.

judicial or quasi judicial bodies. Besides this a professional dealing with VAT authorities has to carefully vouch and

VAT IN OTHER COUNTRIES
VAT does not primarily link tax liability to residence. This means that foreign companies can also become liable for
VAT in countries other than the country where they have their business establishment.
Transactions for the supply of goods or services are normally covered by a sales contract or sales conditions. If drawn
carefully, these contracts or sales conditions will also contain tax clauses. Such clauses are governed by contract
law, which means that their contents should be distinguished from the legal situation according to tax law.
In order to be sure that both parties, i.e., supplier and customer, are fully aware of the VAT (but also e.g., customs,
excise, sales tax) treatment, it is recommendable to verify the tax clauses of the contract or sales conditions
before the agreement is concluded.
Value Added Tax (VAT) is a type of sales tax. In some countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand and
Singapore, this tax is known as “goods and services tax” or GST; and in Japan it is known as “consumption tax”.
VAT is an indirect tax, in that the tax is collected from someone other than the person who actually bears the cost
of the tax (namely the seller rather than the consumer). As VAT is intended as a tax on consumption, exports
(which are, by definition, consumed abroad) are usually not subject to VAT or VAT is refunded.
VAT was first introduced in France in 1954.Worldover more than 145 countries have adopted VAT. List of few countries
that collect VAT include :Algeria, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cameroon,
Chile, China, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,

AUSTRALIA
The Australian Goods and Services Tax (‘GST’) is a value –added tax introduced in Australia in July 2000. It is similar
to the European Union’s VAT system, requiring re-calculation and payments to the tax authorities at each transaction
point in the onward sales chain. The Australian GST is collected by the Australian Tax Office. The revenue is then
redistributed to the states and territories via the Commonwealth Grants Commission process. In essence, this is
Australia’s program of horizontal fiscal equalisation. Whilst the rate is currently set at 10%, there are many domestically
consumed items that are effectively zero-rated (GST-free) such as fresh food, education, and health services, as well
as exemptions for Government charges and fees that are themselves in the nature of taxes.

CANADA
Value added tax in Canada is known as Goods and Services Tax. The goods and services tax was introduced in
Canada on the 1st of January 1991. The goods and services tax in Canada replaced the manufacturers’ sales
taxes. The main purpose behind introducing the goods and services tax was that the manufacturers’ sales tax was
having a negative impact on the export prospects of the manufacturing sector in Canada. The manufacturers’ sales
tax was hidden and the rate of taxation was 13%. The goods and services tax could be called a multi-level tax. In
Canada the value added taxes are taken along with the sales taxes that are applicable for the particular provinces.
The only exception to this is the province of Alberta. There are no sales taxes at the provincial level in Alberta. In

Lesson 19

819

provinces like New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland a Harmonized Sales Tax is charged. The Harmonized
Sales Tax is a combination of goods and services tax and the provincial sales tax.

THE EUROPEAN UNION
The value added tax was perceived by the member-countries of the European Union as the ideal means to
“promote neutrality and uniformity of the tax burden and to provide incentives for increased productivity and
industrialization. Though the EC Fiscal and Financial Committee had recommended as early as 1962 that all
member-countries should shift to the VAT system, the change for the original members was completed only in
1973 when Italy switched over to the VAT. However, certain other recommendations of the committee regarding
uniformity of rates and eventual adoption of the original principle for taxation of trade within the EC were not
implemented immediately.

5. Which of the tax is applicable in the province of Alberta in Canada?
(a) Goods and Services Tax (GST)
(b) Only Sales Tax (RST)
(c) Harmonized Sales Tax (HST)
(d) Value Added Tax (VAT)

FRANCE
The Value Added Tax (VAT) had its origin only in France. The latest innovation is the value-added tax. Its emergence
in France illustrates the process by which a sort of continuing ferment of improvisation now and then gives rise to
an invention of the first order. They were the first Europeans to adopt it in 1954. A new regulation was introduced in
France regarding VAT transaction. Since September 1st, 2006 according to Article 283-1 of the FTC when a supply
of goods or services is carried out by a French VAT liable entity non-established in France, VAT must be selfassessed by the buyer when he is VAT identified in France. VAT registration is mandatory for intra-EV operations.
When the supplier is not established in E.O., the Respondent is necessarily get its Fiscal Representative nominated
through application under Article 289A of French Tax Code (FTC).

GERMANY
On January 1, 1968, Germany replaced its multi-point sales tax on goods and services, which extended down to
the retail stage, by a VAT with a normal rate of 10 per cent and a reduced rate of 5 per cent on foodstuffs and
agricultural products like raw wool raw hides, and timber. The switchover to the VAT was meant to be revenueneutral and was not expected to have any tangible effect on prices.

UNITED KINGDOM
The VAT was introduced in the United Kingdom on 1 April, 1973. As in Spain, this was in fulfillment of one of the key
conditions for entry into the European Community. It is destination-based, general consumer expenditure tax
chargeable on all supplies of goods and services in the country, barring those which are exempted or zero-rated.
The tax is expected to be borne by the final consumer, though collected at each stage of production/trade. The VAT
replaced two of the major indirect taxes levied in the UK earlier, viz., the Purchase Tax (PT) on commodities and the
Selective Employment Tax (SET). The PT was a single stage tax on wholesalers that had to make a distinction
which was often difficult to draw between goods and services and between different categories of dealers and

820 EP-TL&P
goods. The purchase tax was then chargeable at three different rates–25 per cent, 18 per cent and 11.15 per cent and
these rates represented substantial reductions from previous levels in preparation for the introduction of the VAT on the
wholesale values of many goods. The SET was a tax essentially on selected services. The Government felt that these
taxes were inferior to a tax on the value added that could be applied to consumer expenditures comprehensively. On
several counts, the VAT clearly offered a better instrument of taxation. Then there was the EC requirement. It should,
however, be noted that UK would have gone in for the VAT in any case because of its intrinsic merits.

UNITED STATES
The United States, with a federal structure, provides an important case study for consideration of the VAT for any
federal economy in general. Even though the Unites States has been interested in the VAT for the last thirty years,
its actual introduction in the US does not seem to be anywhere near the horizon. The main reason for this situation
is that the United States does not merely appear to be satisfied with its existing states retail sales taxes but the
possibility of the federal government usurping the states’ powers of sales taxation has been keeping it away from
the VAT at a respectable distance. Although attempts for a federal level VAT date as far bask as the proposal by
T.S. Adams in 1921, it was in 1972 that the VAT was recommended as a source of revenue for providing relief on
residential property taxes. The proposed Tax Restructuring multiple rates between 10 and 15 per cent. In the late
seventies, Congressman Ulman came up with a proposal for the VAT to replace part of the pay roll tax, personal
income tax and corporate income tax for $50 billion and $28 billion respectively. This proposal was subjected to a
great deal of public debate even after 1980 when Ulman lost his election.
